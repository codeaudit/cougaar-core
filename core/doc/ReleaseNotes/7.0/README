These are the conversion scripts to help port from 6.8.2 to 7.0.

alp7.pkg	the datafile for doing the bulk of the conversion (repackage)
remaster	The perl script used to drive the conversion of the
		alpine source tree.
repackage	the perl script used to do the actual port. see below
		for instructions.
reorgglm	the perl script to do the GLM ldm package
		cleanup. (see below)


To run the scripts, assuming that *your* software packags aren't
changing:

% cd RootOfYourSourceTree
# if you want to see what it is going to do:
% repackage -vq /your/source/tree/root alp7.pkg
# actually do it:
% repackage /your/source/tree/root alp7.pkg
# apply the glm changes:
% find /your/source/tree/root -name "*.java" -print | reorgglm

I *strongly* recommend that you run the scripts on a copy of your tree.

both repackage and reorgglm can operate of .def, .ini, etc files.

You will probably have to do some minor fixups afterwards.
