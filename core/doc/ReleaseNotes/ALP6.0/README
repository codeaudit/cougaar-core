ALP 6.0 README

The major shift in ALP 6.0 relative to earlier versions is to support
an open-source release of the ALP infrastructure.  This requires:

1. a more regular file (source repository) layout. 

2. a somewhat simplified package layout.  The entire core now resides
under the alp.* package tree.  See the "repackage" script in this
directory. 

3. Simplified parent-task tree, eliminating possibility of mistaken
cross-cluster object traversal.

4. Domain packages.  The core now contains only the basic objects
required for the infrastructure to function.  Domain packages add
additional objects and infrastructure to the core infrastructure to
address their specific problems.  The logistics planning domain is
included with the open source package as an example.  Use the
"refactory" script in this directory to help update sources to use the 
forward-compatible factory classnames.  Also use the "redomain" script 
to help change logistics-domain plugins to use the relocated objects
instead of the old ones.

5. Required libraries are themselves open source whenever possible.
Previous versions of the infrastructure relied on non-OS libraries
(e.g. JGL, Voyager).  Starting with the release, only JDK and OS
libraries will be required, though developers of plugins and optional
components are of course free to use whatever they wish.  Software
contributed to ALPINE for inclusion in the core may not require any
proprietary/closed software.

6. Code generators have been moved to the alp.build package in the
build module.
