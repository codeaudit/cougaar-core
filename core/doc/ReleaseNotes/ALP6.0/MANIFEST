README		An introduction to ALP 6.0

CHANGES		Detailed change list since ALP 5.4

repackage 	a perl script which does most of the work in converting an
		ALP 5.x plugin into using the new package layout.  The
		remaining issues need to be resolved by hand.

refactory	a perl script which converts from LdmFactory to
		RootFactory to avoid a number of deprecation warnings
		related to changes to support Pluggable Domains.
		Because the deprecations will become removed methods
		in a minor release or two, this is strongly
		recommended, though not required.

redomain	Fix up changes in domain package structure.  Suitable
		for use on both plugin source (java) files and on
		config files (e.g. xml) which mention specific fully-
		qualified class names.  Very slow and very inefficient,
		but much faster than doing this job by hand.
	
fixconfigs	fix changes to config file formats.  Change in
		specification of ClusterIdentifier to object from
		String.

reconstant	redirect references to Verb, Role and Preposition
		constants to be domain-savy.  Plugins will probably
		also need to import mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.Constants. 

unjgl		Convert many instances of jgl usage for talking to 
		the infrastructure to non-jgl versions.  Generally
		will not change internal JGL use, nor will it remove
		imports.
