ALP uses a custom classloader for plugins that are appropriately
installed, along with supporting libraries.

The plugin classloader searches for *.{jar,zip,plugin} in the
following order:
	lib/
	plugins/
	<product>/lib/
	$CLASSPATH

All are relative to the value of ALP_INSTALL_PATH.

None of these need to be in your classpath, though the current install 
puts alp-core and voyager jars in lib.

To recap: CLASSPATH should be something like:
	$ALP_INSTALL_PATH/lib/alp-core.jar:$ALP_INSTALL_PATH/lib/voyager.jar
Nothing else should be needed.
