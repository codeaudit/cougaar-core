* MB 7.0

Package reorganization to support COUGAAR opensource release 7.0.
Details may be found in 7.0/alp7.pkg.  Changes are reflected in
javadocs and other documentation.

Default database connection information has been moved out of all
standard ".q" and ".cfg" files.  A file .alprc must be found somewhere
in the config path in order for any of the demonstration configs to
work.  An example .alprc file may be found in this directory as
"example.alprc".

* MB 6.8.2

New PG in alp domain LocationSchedulePG is maintained by
OrgRTDataPlugin (for "Home location") and by new OPlanWatcherLP (for
oplan-directed location assignments).  It is up to consumers to
interpret the schedule and assign semantics.  However, a useful method
is TimeSpanSet.getMinimalIntersectingElement(long time) which when
called on a schedule, will return the shortest element overlapping the
specified time.  This is experimental functionality at this point.

NOTE: TimeSpan MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE are no longer == Long.MIN_VALUE
and MAX_VALUE.  This should not effect correct code, but you
might notice slightly different dates in UIs for elements which
represent unbounded time.  It is very important that you not use
Long.MIN/MAX_VALUE for schedules - *always* use TimeSpan.MIN/MAX_VALUE.

bugfixes

* MB 6.8

The new classloading Node bootstrapper may cause problems with certain 
IDEs.  There are two workarounds:
	1. call Node.launch instead of Node.main.
	2. pass -Dalp.useBootstrapper=false to java command.
Both options require that the classpath be complete and correct, as
the bootstrapper will not do any jar-file searching.

Also, the Bootstrapper's classloader will not load any classes which
start with "java.", "javax.", "sun.", "com.sun." or "net.jini.".  This 
list may be extended by supplying a -Dalp.bootstrapper.exclusions=foo.:bar.
System property.  The value of the property should be a list of 
package prefixes separated by colon (":") characters.

New System property alp.message.fastTransport=true (default is false)
optimizes the rmi message transport for societies where nodes usually
contain multiple clusters.  This option instructs the RMI
MessageTransport to:
 1. send messages via one thread-per node rather than one per cluster
when possible. 
 2. registers each cluster as a redirect to the appropriate node. 
In addition, by default, each node will only register one server
object regardless of how many clusters are served (e.g. multiple
name entries will refer to the same server object).
fastTransport and all the detailed settings it controls
(useNodeDelivery, useNodeRedirect, useServerProxies, useLocalDelivery) 
may be mixed freely within a society so can be used to tune
communities or individual nodes.

The patch to java.io.ObjectInputStream which previously had sources in
the core module and was built into alpio.jar, has been moved to its
own module "javaiopatch".  All the scripts have been updated
accordingly.

Add Automatic generation of "rate" measures in terms of base
measures. See core/doc/details/MeasureWriter.txt for details on new
and old features.  (this part back-patched into MB 6.4.1)
All "rate" measures now implement the interface alp.ldm.measures.Rate.
The old (misnamed) Rate class is still available as AbstractRate.
	
Add support for DataQuality measures on PropertyGroups.  Details are
described in core/doc/details/DataQuality.txt

Replaced old directive message serialization technique with a
lighter-weight solution.  Greatly simplifies most old ldm object
serialization code and allows finally dropping the old persistence
mechanism (long unused).

LogicProviders now appear to publish to the plan instantaneously
rather than having to wait for the end of the transaction.  This makes 
the run model of LPs internally consistant - that is, they are both
invoked at a sub-transaction level and (now) have visibility into the
logplan at the same level of granularity.

PlugIns may now use DynamicUnaryPredicate rather than UnaryPredicate
for subscribing using predicates which select for things which are
expected to change.  Essentially, the new facility will automatically
add or remove objects as a result of change events when the internal
collection is out of phase with the current state of the objects.
There is considerable overhead when using these predicates, so it is
not the default.  It still may only be used for standard subscriptions
(CollectionSubscription and IncrementalSubscription and extensions),
and the base objects that are being selected must be publishChanged by
someone in order to pick up the modifications.

PlugIn.query(UnaryPredicate) is now *much* more efficient than
one-shot subscriptions.  PlugIn should now use query in place of any
existing subscribe/unsubscribe patterns.

New Transaction objects are kept in thread-local references.
Transaction contains the rendezvous point between ChangeReports (which 
had incorrectly been stored on the Publishable objects) and the
subscriber/plan mechanisms.  Also provides a useful hook to whatif
processing.

Old (broken) persistence support has been dropped entirely.  The new
(working) persistence support has been merged into the old package.

The DomainManager will now first initialize Domains from properties
(as before, looking for System properties of the form "alp.domain.foo=...") 
and then from a config file "LDMDomains.ini".  The alpine tree has one 
of these files set up in the configs/common directory for alpine demo
use.  We expect that most people will prefer to the file method, but
both are retained for compatability and flexibility.

Node now uses Bootstrapper to re-classload itself with searched-for
jars, etc.  The makes it possible to start alp with only core.jar in
the classpath.  Startup scripts have been updated (simplified)
accordingly.  Classpath is still honored, and takes precedence over
searched-for jars.  See alp.society.Bootstrapper for more information.

New (non-core) module "server" implements an application-server-like
mechanism for running nodes (and societies) remotely.  This facility
is intended to be used for testing&integration and (perhaps) demo
use. See server/doc/README for basic documentation and instructions.

New default behavior for BehaviorGroups. See
core/doc/details/BehaviorGroups.txt for details.
