Notes on Java2 port of ALP

Third-party packages should either be installed as extensions in
JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext (where JAVA_HOME is wherever java is installed
on your machine) or should be entered in your CLASSPATH before running 
the Node scripts.

JGL has not yet been released for Java2, and Alpine has decided to put 
off porting to standard Java2 Collections until we can evaluate the
Objectspace JGL port.  For now, we recommend recompiling JGL 3.1.0 for
java2 yourself.  Included in this directory is the (unix) shell script 
for producing a jgl.jar file from the JGL 3.1.0 sources: compileJGL
