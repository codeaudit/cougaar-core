/**
 * This is a very simple "stand-alone" Servlet, with no Cougaar 
 * dependencies, that just prints "Hello world!" to the client.
 * <p>
 * This is just like the "tutorial" Servlets you would find
 * online, such as:<pre>
 *   <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/servlets">
 *   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/servlets</a>
 * </pre>
 * This Servlet is unable to ask about Cougaar internals, such
 * as a query into the Blackboard.  Other classes in this package
 * will provide such Cougaar-internal examples.
 * <p>
 * This Servlet can be loaded with the Cougaar "servlet-loader" plugin
 * by adding this line to the ".INI" file of any agent:<pre>
 *    plugin = org.cougaar.core.servlet.SimpleServletComponent(org.cougaar.core.examples.servlet.HelloServlet, /hello)
 * </pre>
 * The above line tells the loader to associate the path "/hello" 
 * with this class.  If this line was added to agent X's ".INI", 
 * then this Servlet will be invoked when a browser requests:<pre>
 *    <a href="http://localhost:8800/$X/hello">
 *    http://localhost:8800/$X/hello</a>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The above "localhost:8800" assumes that machine "localhost" 
 * is running a node (any node in the society, not just agent X's 
 * node), and that the node is configured to run the webserver on
 * port 8800.  See the "webserver/doc/install.html" for details.
 * <p>
 * The output to the browser should look like:<pre>
 *   Hello world!
 * </pre>
