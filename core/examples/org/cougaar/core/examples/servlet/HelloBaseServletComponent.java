/**
 * This is an example of a full-fledged Component that uses
 * the "BaseServletComponent" base-class to configure
 * its path and Servlet.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the "Hello*Servlet" examples, this Component loads itself
 * with this ".INI" line:<pre>
 *    plugin = org.cougaar.core.examples.servlet.HelloBaseServletComponent
 * </pre>
 * The path is hard-coded to "/hello", so in agent X this would respond
 * to "http://localhost:8800/$X/hello" requests.
 * <p>
 * See "BaseServletComponent" for javadoc details.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the simple "HelloServlet", this class has access to 
 * the BindingSite and ServiceBroker of the BaseServletComponent.
 * This is illustrated in "HelloLogServletComponent" by getting
 * the LoggingService.
 * <p>
 * The output to the browser should look like:<pre>
 *   Hello world from self-loaded servlet!
 * </pre>
