Example ServletService code, in recommended order for learning
the Cougaar Servlet APIs:

HelloServlet.java:
  A simple "Hello world!" Servlet with no Cougaar dependencies.

SnoopServlet.java:
  Another Cougaar-independent example.  This Servlet calls
  all the various HttpServletRequest methods and prints the
  results back to an HTML page.  Load it and learn by
  example.

ColorServlet.java:
  Another Cougaar-independent example that illustrates
  HTML FORMs and URL-parameter passing.

HelloAgentServlet.java:
  Similar to "HelloServlet", but additionally uses the
  "SimpleServletSupport" API to print the agent's name.

HelloBaseServletComponent.java:
  Extends "BaseServletComponent" to create a "Hello world!" 
  Servlet.  Unlike HelloServlet, this Servlet has access to
  the full BindingSite and ServiceBroker.  The inner Servlet
  is hard-coded to the "/hello" path.

LogServletComponent.java:
  Just like "HelloBaseServletComponent", but additionally
  illustrates use of the ServiceBroker to access the
  LoggingService.  The inner Servlet is hard-coded to the 
  "/log" path.

AddTaskServletComponent.java:
  Just like "HelloBaseServletComponent", but additionally
  gets the BlackboardService and "publishAdd"s a Task
  to the blackboard.  The inner Servlet is hard-coded to
  the "/addtask" path.

HelloComponent.java:
  A "Hello world!" example that uses "ServletService" directly,
  without extending the "BaseServletComponent".  Plugins with
  internal Servlets can be built in a similar fashion.  The 
  inner Servlet is hard-coded to the "/hello" path.

FileServletComponent.java:
  Example component that uses the "ServletService" directly
  to listen for "/file?name=FILENAME" requests.  The 
  ConfigFinder is then used to stream back the contents of
  the named file to the client.  This can be used to embed
  "&lt;img src=..&gt;" tags in HTML pages, where the image
  is a file on a node's config-path.
