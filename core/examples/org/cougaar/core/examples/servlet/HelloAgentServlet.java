/**
 * This Servlet is very much like the "HelloServlet", except
 * that the constructor accepts a "SimpleServletSupport" API
 * from the "servlet-loader" plugin.
 * <p>
 * Follow the instructions in "HelloServlet" for loading this
 * Servlet into an agent.
 * <p>
 * The "SimpleServletSupport" API provides a couple <i>simple</i>
 * methods for the Servlet to call:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>get the agent's name</li>
 *   <li>query the blackboard</li>
 *   <li>get the names of all the agents in the society</li>
 * </ul>
 * See the javadocs for details.  This API is sufficient for 
 * many simplistic Servlets, such as the "/tasks" Servlet.
 * <p>
 * The output to the browser should look like:<pre>
 *   Hello world from agent X!
 * </pre>
