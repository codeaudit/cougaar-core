Simple inter-agent "ping" code, primarily intended for 
infrastructure testing of message transport and agent
mobility.

<p>
The "Ping" class is the API, and the "PingImpl" is the 
Relay-based implementation.

<p>
The "PingAdderPlugin" can be used to create pings at
startup.  Minimally four plugin parameters must be
specified:<pre>
  [+]startTime, timeoutMillis, limit [, target0, .. targetN]
</pre>
For example, to create a series of 5 pings to agent X at 
20 seconds after startup, and to wait at most 30 seconds for 
any ping to complete:<pre>
  +20000, 30000, 5, X
</pre>
Another example: to create an infinite series of pings to 
agent X at startup, with no timeout:<pre>
  0, 0, 0, X
</pre>
Note that the frequency of pings is controlled by the 
"PingTimerPlugin", which is described below.

<p>
The "PingServlet" displays locally generated pings,
and allows the user to create new pings.  This is 
a component that loads its own internal servlet, and
does not use the "SimpleServletComponent".  A single
plugin parameter can optionally be used to override 
the default "/ping" servlet path.

<p>
The "PingTimerPlugin" uses a periodic alarm to
timeout overdue pings and recycle pings for the specified
number of rounds.  It requires a timera frequence as
a parameter (e.g. 5000 to check every 5 seconds).
