/** DAB is a Dummy Agent Binder, an example wrapping binder for
 * agents to be used as a trivial example to code writers.
 * A node.ini recipe can load this as a wrapping binder as:
 * <pre>
 * Node.AgentManager.Binder = org.cougaar.core.examples.DAB
 * </pre>
 * Then when run, you'll see one message indicating that the DAB
 * has been instantiated, and n+1 messages indicating that a DABber
 * has, where n = number of agents (the extra one is the NodeAgent).
