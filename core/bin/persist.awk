# Cougaar log4j log parser to extract persistence information.
#
# The log4j configuration must include these lines:
#   log4j.category.org.cougaar.core.blackboard.Distributor=INFO
#   log4j.category.org.cougaar.core.persist.BasePersistence=INFO
#
# Parse the log4j ".log" files by running:
#   awk -f persist.awk *.log > persist.csv
#
# View the output with Gantt Chart UI (bug 2415):
#   java \
#    -classpath /opt/cougaar/lib/core.jar:/opt/cougaar/lib/datagrabber.jar \
#    org.cougaar.mlm.ui.newtpfdd.gui.view.FileGanttChartView \
#    persist.csv
#
# The UI will show per-agent rows, where the color on for each
# row segment indicates:
#    grey:    normal running, periodically interrupted to persist, e.g.
#               every 5 minutes
#    blue:    waiting for transactions to close.  Mouse-over will show
#               the number of open transactions
#    yellow:  waiting for jvm persist lock (bug 2370)
#    red:     serializing while in the jvm persist lock.  This causes
#               other agents in the node to display yellow.
#    green:   writing the persistence shapshot to I/O
#
# This sed command will remove the "node__" prefix:
#    cat output.csv | \
#     sed -e 's/[^_]*__//' \
#     > output2.csv
#
# This sed command will reorder the output to obtain "agent__node" order:
#    cat output.csv | \
#     sed -e 's/\([^_]*\)__\([^,]*\)/\2__\1/' \
#     > output3.csv
#
# This awk script is nearly perl, so I should probably port it!
