2001-06-15 Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* ClusterImpl, SharedPlugInManager, SharedThreadingService,
	PlugInAdaper, etc
	Move PlugIn shared threading to a service.  SharedPlugInManager
	now implements SharedThreadingService.
	SharedThreadingServiceProvider
	is responsible for creating a SharedPlugInManager for each
	cluster. There are no hooks to Shared Threading in Cluster or
	PlugInManager now.


2001-05-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Add a default-enabled setting org.cougaar.message.lazyLookup which
	batches namespace lookups instead of having each destination queue
	do the job.  This can dramatically reduce the number of threads
	used in "cut down" societies, and is an expecially big win when
	useNodeDelivery=true or fastTransport=true.

2001-05-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DBConnectionPool
	Add additional debugging support when runtime-enabled.

	* ScoringFunction
	Cache Best points which had often been recomputed every time.

	* RMINameServer
	Implement a fast, RMI-less query path when the nameserver is in
	the same VM.

2001-04-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/TimeSpanSet.java:
	Bug #373
	Reimplement search as binary search to speed up insertions.

	* org/cougaar/util/MoreMath.java:
	Bug #372
	New method: nearlyEqual compares two doubles for near equality.
	Equality comparisons of doubles is instrinsically difficult
	because of rounding. This methods checks the relative difference
	between two doubles and their values. There are two versions, one
	with a fixed tolerance of one part per billion and one with a
	specifiable tolerance.

2001-04-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResultAggregator
	Aggregate only results actually reported.  Actually has a
	significantly lower memory load then before as well.
	Fixes bug 322. 

2001-04-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogPlan, Distributor, etc
	Added functionality to allow LPs to delay execution of a body of
	code until the end of the LP transaction.  The most important use
	of this is to "roll up" redundant operations into fewer
	operations).

2001-04-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Add support for org.cougaar.core.society.bootstrapper.loud={false,true,shout}.
	false, the default, leaves behavior untouched.  true dumps the
	ordered list of jar,zip,directorys searched by the classloader at
	startup time. shout additionally lists the file used to load every
	class loaded by the bootstrap classloader. (bug 299)

2001-04-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP.java:
	Suppress DeferredRescind failed message. This is innocuous and
	happens when a TaskRescind is repeated as part of rehydration
	recovery.
	Force remove of plan element added after its task has been
	rescinded. Because of timing issues, the plan element may not be
	in the PlanElementSet, but may need to be removed anyway.

2001-04-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP.java:
	Suppress DeferredRescind failed message. This is innocuous and

	recovery.
	Force remove of plan element added after its task has been

2001-03-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Domain, DomainManager, ClusterImpl
	Support optional domain-name aliases for Domains.  See Domain
	javadoc for information.
	
2001-03-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* unalp
	Removed remaining references to ALP from codebase. See
	core/doc/CHANGES and core/doc/8.0/unalp for info.

2001-03-28  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Persistence
	Modifications to reduce creation of byte arrays during
	persistence. Requested by Mark Sutterlin. For large deltas, these
	arrays consume lots of memory and having multiple copies of the
	same information is problematic. Instead, serialized data is
	streamed directly to the output stream. In the case of database
	persistence, the outputstream streams directly to the database as
	well.

	* EnvelopeTuple
	Bug #181
	Check nullity of arguments in constructors of EnvelopeTuple to
	catch bogus objects sooner. Throws IllegalArgumentException.
	BulkEnvelopeTuple also checks objects when dispensing the objects,
	but not in the constructor due to the cost.

2001-03-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* rmi
	generate only 1.2 and later stubs rather than the old 1.1 RMI
	protocol, too.

	* version.def
	Bump version 8.0, even though we are still officially only at
	7.3. 

2001-03-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* version.def
	Bump version to 7.2.0.

2001-03-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPPlan
	Modified sendDirective variations to throw an
	IllegalArgumentException when called with null.  This lets us know
	where the real problem lays rather than getting a NPE when the
	directive queue is emptied.  Fixes bug 182

2001-03-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* IncrementalSubscription
	Changes get*Collection accessors to return empty collections
	rather than nulls.  Bug 164.

2001-03-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PublishException -- et. al.
	Add boolean to PublishException indicating whether the lack of a
	prior publisher is because prior publishers are not being saved or
	because there was not prior publisher. The exception message
	reflects this difference.

	* release
	Released MB 7.0.1
	
2001-02-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>
	
	* SharedPlugInManager
	Upped warning time to 2 minutes.  Changable via 
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPlugInManager.warningTime=N where
	N is milliseconds the plugin has to run before being suspect.
	Also aded a control for dumping the stats file separate from
	collection. -Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPlugInManager.dumpStatistics=false

	* org.cougaar.util.PropertyParser
	Finally created this utility for parsing out values of various
	types from java.util.Properties.  By default, takes from System
	properties.  Doesn't reimplement facilities already found
	elsewhere, e.g. getString and no-default property getters.

	* PublishHistory
	New facility to assist in debugging publishing errors.

	PublishHistory keeps a stack dump for the most recent add, change,
	and publish events for an object. The stack dumps are flushed
	after a minute of inactivity for the object. The stack dumps for
	any particular object may be dumped as needed.
	
	A PublishHistory object may be instantiated in the Distributor and
	accessed from the Subscriber (for saving publishing events) and
	from the ALPPlan. The interfaces for the ALPPlan and LogPlan have
	been augmented to allow the history object to be retrieved.
	
	The ComplainingLP has been modified to use to dump the recent
	stack traces for objects about which it complains.

	The history object is only instantiated if
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.publishHistory=true

2001-02-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SharedPlugInManager
	I just checked in some new facilities useful for debugging and
	performance analysis.  The basic idea is to watch how simple
	plugins are scheduled: we can watch how long "Shared Thread"
	plugins take to execute and keep statistics.  We also watch to see
	if plugins block or otherwise fail to return from execute(). 
	
	org.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPlugInManager.statistics=false Set
	it to true to get periodic dumps of plugin statistics to the file
	<NODENAME>.statistics in the current directory.  Requires that the
	watcher be enabled in order to actually get the output, but
	perhaps some metrics display should get access to the info. 

	org.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPlugInManager.watching=true Set it
	to false to disable the watcher (default is enabled). When enabled,
	will complain whever it sees a plugin run or block for more than
	15 seconds.  It will also cause the above statistics file(s) to be
	(re)generated approximately every two minutes.  The watcher is one
	thread per vm, so it isn't too expensive.

	* DBConnectionPool
	Retry getConnection and createStatement on known possibly
	continuable exceptions.  Also reap idle connections after
	only 10 seconds.

2001-02-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DBConnectionPool
	Add control parameters and debugging support.

2001-02-15  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DeletionPlugIn
	Add DeletionPolicy for specifying deletion delay for classes of
	Tasks. A DeletionPolicy has three RuleParameters: a
	PredicateRuleParameter for selecting Tasks, a LongRuleParameter
	for specifying the deletion delay and a IntegerRuleParameter for
	specifying a priority. DeletionPolicies are used in descending
	order of priority until one is found that matches a task and the
	association deletion delay is added to the task end time to
	determine when the task can be deleted.

	A DefaultDeletionPolicy is used if no other DeletionPolicy is
	found.

	* PredicateRuleParameter
	New RuleParameter holding a UnaryPredicate. "In range" means the
	predicate returns true.

	* LongRuleParameter
	New RuleParameter a la IntegerRuleParameter holding longs instead
	of ints.

2001-02-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org.cougaar.util.DBConnectionPool
	Promoted delta's connection pool manager to util.

2001-02-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetTransferLP and ReceiveAssetTransferLP
	New relationship schedules are only sent if changes show the
	presence of a
	RelationshipSchedule.RelationshipScheduleChangeReport. If no
	schedule is received, the relationships are left alone; only
	property groups are update.

2001-01-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Added ComplainingLP
	Error checking LP complains about problematic LogPlan changes
	such as publishChanging an object which isn't in the plan.  Since
	LPs are applied after subscription changes, they cannot do things
	like check for redundant adds or removes - sigh.

2001-01-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org.cougaar.util.Parameters
	More extensive Parameter File handling.  Now reads
	"$home/.cougaarrc" *and* searches the config path for "cougaar.rc"
	in addition to searching for .alprc in the usual places.  .alprc
	processing will, of course, be dropped at some point.

2001-01-05  Noelle Givler <ngivler@bbn.com>
	* org.cougaar.domain.planning.ldm.plan.Schedule

	Changes to the 7.0 tree designed to make access to 
	org.cougaar.domain.planning.ldm.plan.Schedule and extenders thread 
	safe. The changes should be transparent with one exception - 
	Schedule.iterator() now returns an Iterator over a copy of the 
	schedule. Calls to Iterator.remove() will not affect the schedule and
	changes to the schedule while the Iterator is being used will not be
	visible. This change was introduced to prevent the 
	ComodificationExceptions we were seeing last year. 

	Calls to Schedule.iterator() also print a stack trace to System.err. 
	To avoid stack trace (and to make the code more explicit), you can 
	copy the schedule to an ArrayList before iterating. The following code
	returns a copy of the entire schedule.
	
	  ArrayList copy = new ArrayList(schedule);

	
	If you are iterating over the schedule and screening at each step, 
	you can create an UnaryPredicate which performs the screen and then
	call Schedule.filter(UnaryPredicate). The following code example uses
	a UnaryPredicate to find all AssignedAvailabilityElements and then
	calls Schedule.removeAll to remove the elements from the schedule.
	
	  Collection remove = availSchedule.filter(new UnaryPredicate()  {
            public boolean execute(Object o) {
              return (o instanceof AssignedAvailabilityElement)
	    }
	  });
	  availSchedule.removeAll(remove);


	
2000-11-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.OptionPane
	This is a replacement for JOptionPane that fixes the workaround
	for bug#4135218. That workaround computes a static adjustment of
	the preferred size of the JOptionPane inside a JDialog. The static
	adjustment fails to account for UI changes such as those used to
	make fonts bigger in demo mode.

	alp.util.OptionPane extends JOptionPane and supplies replacements
	for the two basic methods: showOptionPane and showInputPane. It
	does not furnish replacements for the convenience versions of
	these methods having fewer arguments or with certain defaults.
	Since static methods can't be overridden, to use this replacement,
	you must use the full blown basic methods.

2000-11-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AlertParameter
	Add isVisible, setVisible, isEditable, and setEditable. Invisible
	parameters can be used to carry information that doesn't need/want
	to be displayed. Editable parameters can be used to all the
	operator to alter values.

	* AllocationResult
	Fix Bug 61, range check of aspect type.

2000-10-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceInputStream
	Use introspection rather than superclass calls so that we can
	avoid all sorts of compile-time complexity with javaiopatch.
	The result is that while javaiopatch is still required in
	bootclasspath at runtime when persistence is activated, it is no
	longer required at compile time.

2000-10-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence
	Provide a ClusterContext for rehydration so that Assets, for
	instance, are reattached to the local LDM.  To deserialization
	methods, the situation will appear as though they were being
	deserialized within a message from the cluster to itself.

	* Subscriber
	Disable, by default, unpublished change warnings.
	-Dalp.subscriber.warnUnpublishChanges=true will re-enable them.

2000-10-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Subscriber
	Use the right accessor to find the correct transaction to get the
	unposted change reports to avoid potentially very confusing
	warnings (phew!).

	* ALPPlan, LogPlan
	Plug a memory leak.  Also minor cleanup.

2000-10-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ObjectInputStream
	Moved to javaiopatch module.

2000-10-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSet, ClusterImpl, DomainManager, Registry, RootFactory
	Back off use of StringKey.  AssetSet was the only remaining
	high-bandwidth user of StringKey.  My suspicion is that the
	speedup on non-hotspot VMs is propably below the waterline and the 
	slowdown on hotspotful VMs is a win, especially in reduced consing 
	costs.  We'll not re-insert this optimization without re-analysis
	of actual performance, as even micro-benchmarks show interpreted
	performace, e.g. within optimiz-it, as artificially widening the
	gap on VMs which have String.hashCode problem.

2000-10-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* EssentialAssetFactory
	Added hashCode and equals methods.

	* RootFactory
	Redundantly adding asset/pg factories quietly tolerated.
	Added containsPropertyGroupFactory and containsAssetFactory
	methods as a preferred way to tell if a factory is already
	loaded. addPropertyGroupFactory now allows passing in the class
	in addition to an instance, since only the class is ever used.
	Also cleaned out some old code.

2000-10-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Extend the list of classes not loaded by the custom classloader.
	Also provide a method to extend the list.  See Bootstrapper
	javadoc for details.

	* alp.society.LsNS
	A mini-application which recursively prints the entire contents of 
	the NameServer.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Support a variety of toggles which control how message queues map
	to threads and RMI server objects.  Should be considered
	experimental as this point, but may eventually become the default.
	To activate, set alp.message.fastTransport=true.
	Results in reduced threading and better network multiplexing, so
	should result in lower overall network cost, especially for
	societies where nodes have many clusters.  Minimal or zero benefit 
	for societies where each node supports a single cluster.
	
	See javadoc or core/doc/ReleaseNotes/CHANGES for more info.

2000-10-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Can be used as a top-level bootstrapper for arbitrary classes.
	First argument specifies the class, the rest are passed to the
	public static method class.launch or class.main.

2000-10-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence
	Only one cluster of a node at a time may be actively persisting at 
	once.  What a sad hack... sigh.

	* Node
	System property alp.useBootstrapper=false can be used to
	circumvent the bootstrapper and the jar-file search.  Of course,
	this means that the incoming classpath needs to be correctly set
	up before invocation.  Users of IDEs may want to invoke
	Node.launch instead of Node.main as an alternative way of
	circumventing the custom classloader.

	* EventEnvelopeTuple, EventSubscription
	Initial infrastructure for non-persistent event distribution
	between intra-cluster entities handling in-band with respect to
	transactions. The goal is to make alarm/wake/timer events be
	handled this way.

2000-09-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Node
	Node now re-launches itself using Bootstrapper.  This allows huge
	simplification of the startup scripts and makes it reasonable to
	have some basic scripts in the core bin directory.
	
	* Bootstrapper
	Searches a predicable set of locations and then launches a class
	(main-like) using a custom classloader.
	
	* UID
	Smaller datastructure with full backward compatability.  Now
	stores "FOO" and a long instead of "FOO/<long>".

2000-09-25  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.Random
	Extends java.util.Random to add nextPoisson(double mean) that
	returns a random deviate drawn from a Poisson distribution having
	the specified mean.

	* alp.util.MoreMath
	Additional math functions. Specifically, gammaLn computes the
	natural log of the gamma function. Useful for statistical
	calculations (see alp.util.Random).

2000-09-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Measure, Derivative
	Support a richer API for gui and closer-to-measure-neutral use
	without requiring introspection.

	* measures.def
	Minor changes to Speed et al - add some units, drop others.

2000-09-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DomainManager
	Also looks in config file LDMDomains.ini to find domain
	specifications. Added one in alpine configs/common and updated
	scripts.  Also copied some basic scripts over to core/bin so that
	there is something useful there for the COUGAAR distribution.

	* Bootstrapper, Node
	Bootstrapper implements a special classloader, then launches the
	specified class using that loader.  Allows searching for all
	appropriate jar files.  Would be good to implement node-level jar
	authentication at this point.  Node now uses Bootstrapper.

2000-09-20  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.cluster
	Added longer schedule of execution timer changes so that more
	complex patterns of execution time can be specified. Added
	interface for specifying a series of time changes that are
	consistent with each other, e.g., "In 5 seconds change to rate
	1440 for 25 seconds and then switch to rate 1.0".

2000-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.measure
	Added Measure and Derivative interfaces.  Updated AbstractMeasure
	to match. Updated measures.def to take advantage of new features
	of MeasureWriter.  In particular, Rate is now an interface rather
	than a class.  The old Rate class functionality is now AbstractRate.

	* alp.persist*.*
	Rename alp.persist2.* to alp.persist.*.

2000-09-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Transaction
	Finally, a real Transaction abstraction.  Supports ChangeReport
	collection per object.  Stores reference in a thread-local
	variable to make sure it is available to all.
	
	* Update
	ALPPlan, Subscriber, PublishableAdapter, Publishable to use
	Transaction.  PublishableAdapter now uses the Transaction
	mechanism for ChangeReport collection.	Subscriber may choose the
	Transaction class to use to support fancier interation mechanisms:
	e.g. for whatif.  Complains if there are outstanding changes left
	on transaction close.

	Removed noteChangeReport from PublishableAdapter and updated
	TaskImpl and PlanElementImpl to call Transaction.noteChangeReport
	directly.
	
2000-08-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResultAggregator, TaskScoreTable
	Performance improvements. Bug 32.

2000-08-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ExecutionTimer et. al.
	Multiple files changed to implement variable rate execution clock.
	The current execution time is computed as
	System.currentTimeMillis() * rate + offset. The API allows the
	rate and offset to be changed as well as specify the time at which
	the change is to take effect. Time parameter changes are strictly
	ordered so that only the dominant change needs to be kept.

	* PlanElement et. al.
	Multiple files changed to add observed allocation results. Tasks
	now have "observable aspects" such that observed results of these
	aspects can created. The observed results are merged with other
	received (not observed) results to form the reported results.

2000-08-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFinder
	If alp.config is not defined the value "common" is used instead of
	minitestconfig. This means that, usually, no config files will be
	found unless they are in "." or $HOME/.alp since the standard
	alp.config.path will simply include $INSTALL/configs/common twice.
	This was done to reduce the surprise when config files are found
	in minitestconfig when that isn't the actual configuration being
	used.

2000-08-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	implement Publishable.

	* ALPPlan, LogPlan
	Fix stupid infinite loop while calling getWorkflowCount.

	* Debug, etc
	Eliminate unused references to Debug facility.

	* Citizen, ClusterProfile, Node
	Clean up - remove Citizen, simplify other code to prepare for app
	server merge

2000-08-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Timer, RealTimer, ExecutionTimer
	Renamed ScenarioTimer to ExecutionTimer.  Extended Timer with
	RealTimer and made the base class abstract.  Updated ClusterImpl.

	* Communications
	Fix bug where -ns argument to Node was not functional.
	Expand syntax allowed for alp.name.server to allow for full
	specification: e.g. host[:port[:lpsport]].  -ns just sets
	alp.name.server so has the same syntax.

2000-08-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* QuerySubscription, PlugInAdapter, Subscriber, Distributor, ALPPlan
	Make query() avoid most subscription overhead.

2000-08-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* HysteresisProvider, SubscriptionEnvelope:
 	Removed as they are no longer supported anyway.

2000-08-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CollectionSubscription
	Now implements and advertises Collection.

	* CollectionSubscription
	When using a DynamicUnaryPredicate, alters its behavior so that it 
	attempts to handle implicit adds and removes of objects in
	response to change reports.  This is rather more expensive than
	the standard UnaryPredicate case, so should only be used with cause.

	* *EnvelopeTuple, Subscription, et.al.
	Move the predicate testing logic from the tuple into the
	subscription.  While this does not change the logic flow, it moves 
	the boundaries around a little both to make things a little more
	OO-orderly, as well as to make the new DynamicUnaryPredicate
	handling implementation simpler.  Essentially, what used to happen 
	was:
		AddEnvelopeTuple.applyToSubscription()
		  if(Subscription.getPredicate().execute())
		    Subscription.privateAdd()
	now:
		AddEnvelopeTuple.applyToSubscription()
		  Subscription.conditionalAdd()
		    if (predicate.execute())
		      privateAdd();
	
	This also lets us keep the subscription predicate non-public.
	
	* DynamicUnaryPredicate
	Marker for a UnaryPredicate which tests for mutable properties of
	objects. 
	
	* SimpleSubscription, Subscriber
	remove SimpleSubscription.  Just use CollectionSubscription
	instead: Subscriber so modified.

	* CollectionSubscription
	Make it non-abstract.
	
2000-08-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogicProvider, alp.cluster.*
	Allow for a consistent logic-provider threading model.  In
	particular, LPs have always operated on a sub-transaction basis,
	yet the products of LPs have not been available to themselves
	until the end of the transaction.  The new behavior allows LPs to
	immediately effect the logplan via add/remove/change so that
	ALPPlan and XPlan subscriptions are visibly updated.  This change
	should not alter extra-LP visibility at all.

2000-08-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Verb, Role, etc
	Add back various serialization optimizations which had been
	implemented by Object{Input,Output}StreamWithContext.
	
	* ObjectInputStreamWithContext, ObjectOutputStreamWithContext 
	Removed now unused classes and cut dangling imports.  

	* ALPObjectStream, ComplexObject, MessageContext, alp.io.*
	More serialization cleanup.  Removed classes, no longer need
	the package. Remove old import references.

2000-08-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.(various)
	Changed implementations so that they no longer key off of
	AlpObject*Stream instances.  Occasionally check for persistence
	streams, sometimes check context, e.g. for Asset.  Most of these
	could now be further simplified to use default serialization
	instead of needing transients and custom read/riteObject methods.

	* alp.persist
	Dropped most of ancient persistence implementation, which had been 
	subject to extensive bit rot and depended on ALPObject*Stream
	functionality. 
	
	* ALPObject*Stream, etc.
	Dropped ALPObjectInputStream, ALPObjectOutputStream in favor of
	lighter-weight context discovery mechanism using thread-local
	variables.  See ClusterContextTable statics for implementation
	and DirectiveMessage for use.  Left are the implementations of
	ObjectInput/OutputStreamWithContext for reference on some
	potential optimizations to add back at a later point.  These
	optimizations need to be reexamined anyway as they are likely to
	be stale by now.

	
2000-08-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* properties.def
	Disable DataQuality support for all core PGs.

	* PropertyGroup
	add boolean hasDataQuality() method.

	* alp.ldm.dq.DataQuality, HasDataQuality, NewHasDataQuality
	DataQuality support classes.

2000-08-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* measures.def
	Use new MeasureWriter features to better define CostRate, Speed,
	MassTransferRate, FlowRate.  Added TimeRate to support "time
	consumed for an activity per time unit".  

	Replaced bogus Volume.TONS with Volume.MTONS with the correct
	value.  The old TONS was equivalent to 100 cubic feet.

2000-07-26  Jim Winston <jwinston@bbn.com>

	* alp.ui.planserver.server, alp.ui.planserver.server.slp
	Silenced verbose messages to System.out
	
2000-07-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Task, NewTask, TaskImpl
	Add support for EventGenerator: addObservableAspect and
	getObservableAspects allow specification and retrieval of the
	aspects of the allocation result of the disposition of the task
	that can be observed in reports generated by the event generator.

2000-07-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterContextTable, DirectiveMessage
	Beginnings of eliminating the nested serialization stream for
	directive/cluster messages.  This change is just to support the
	new Thread-local state on serialization/deserialization -- no old
	functionality has been removed.

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Fix bug where setFooPG with a non-immediate slot can result in
	multiple versions of the PG on the otherPGs list.  We now will
	replace the first matching PG rather than blindly adding it.
	May result in a very slight performance hit with long PG lists,
	but much more correct.  Also tweak synchronization slightly to
	improve correctness and safety.

2000-07-14  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* IncrementalSubscription, SortedSubscription
	New subscription class that returns elements() and getAddedList()
	in sorted order. IncrementSubscription modified to expose creation
	of the added set so that the SortedSubscription subclass can
	override to create a SortedSet. Other methods of
	IncrementalSubscription are overridden to detect changes that
	might disorder the collection.

2000-07-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset, RootFactory
	Simplify LDM registration process.  For non-factories Asset
	instance registration, just call asset.registerWithLDM(ldm)
	instead of setUID(nextUID) and bindToLDM(ldm);

2000-07-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.Stack
	Removed.  Hasn't been used since pre-jdk1.2 days.

	* ClusterServesPlugIn, ClusterImpl
	Provide ConfigFinder instance to plugins for forward
	compatability.  Current implementation just returns the
	singleton. 

	* ConfigFinder, ConfigFileFinder
	Merge in ZIP file support from susan.

2000-06-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFinder, ConfigFileFinder
	new class ConfigFinder is a non-static, more generalized version
	of ConfigFileFinder.  ConfigFileFinder has been updated to use the 
	singleton version of ConfigFinder.

2000-06-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Communications
	Fix selection of message transports.  There is still plenty of
	opportunity for cleanup here.

	* DirectiveMessage
	Comment out the checks and calls to exit so that we can again run
	multi-node on the same machine.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Don't generate an exception when a name lookup returns null.

	* alp.util.Reflect
	Add memoized Constructor retrieval and getMethod, getConstructor
	methods which return null rather than exceptions on not finding
	the appropriate item in the class.

2000-06-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Added optimistic persistence support. This allows for rehydration
	from persistence information that is not in sync with the state of
	other clusters. Discrepancies are reconciled by resending Tasks,
	AssetAssignments, and TransferableTransfers to insure that other
	clusters have the objects implied by the rehydrated state and by
	sending Notifications, AssetVerifications, and
	TransferableVerifications for objects in the rehydrated state of
	the cluster. The other clusters rescind any object mentioned in
	the verification message that is not current.

	* MessageManagerImpl
	Detect restarted clusters and initiate the resynchronization process.

2000-06-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Make slightly more modular to support subclassing in order to add
	QUO-style rmi proxies.  An example of client-side use is supplied
	in a comment.  Added generateServerSideProxy and
	generateClientSideProxy methods.

2000-06-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* various
	Remove double-check tricks to avoid sync because it is subtly
	dangerous: out-of-order constructor/assign execution can result in 
	visibility of pre-constructor-called objects.

2000-06-02  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>
  
	* Workflow and Composition isPropagating changes
	Default for propagation flag is now TRUE.
	Setter for propagating flag on workflows and compositions now
	takes a boolean argument instead of being a one time setter.
	Old setters are deprecated for now.
	Workflows and their subtasks, regardless of the value of the 
	propagation flag, are no longer published as a result of an expansion
	being published.
	Workflows are no longer active subscription objects.
	All active subscription removal logic that was in WorkflowImpl
	(that is still valid) has been moved up to ExpansionImpl.
	SimplePlugIn and the helper classes have been updated/added to
	to not call setispropagating as the default is now true.
	SimplePlugIn and the helper classes have been updated/added to 
	with publishAddExpansion(subscriber, planelement) which now publishes the
	expansion planelement AND any subtasks on the workflow.


2000-05-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Directive
	Require that all directives are Serializable.  Fixes serialization 
	of DirectiveWithChangeReports bug.

2000-05-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Merge in changes from ALP6.2 (stable) up to ALP62M1 merge point.

2000-05-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TimeAspectValue
	Add a timeValue alias for longValue.

2000-05-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Task, NewTask, TaskImpl
	Collect detailed changeReports for preference modifications

	* ChangeReport, et.al.
	Detailed ChangeReport support, with LP and messaging complete.
	
2000-05-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.cluster.ALPPlan etc.
	LogPlan-like objects need to be domain-specific. Because the
	collection of domains is arbitrary, cannot use
	inheritance. Instead LogPlan and similar "XPlans" must implement
	XPlanServesALPPlan and must be created by the Domain. XPlans
	delegate the ALPPlanServesLogicProvider methods the the underlying
	ALPPlan.

2000-05-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.asset.PGDelegate
	Required interface for BehaviorGroup delegation.  See 
	ReleaseNotes/ALP6.2/BehaviorGroups.txt for details.
	
2000-05-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl
	Fix obscure bug which manifested when using a UI to examine tasks
	with preferences but no prepositional phrases and which had been
	serialized.

	* Simplified*PlugIn
	deprecated.  Better to use SimplePlugIn et al.

	* EssentialPlugIn
	Removed. Ancient, easy to break, incomplete... gone.

	* TaskImpl, PlanElementImpl
	Fix references to static inner classes of interfaces so that javac 
	can compile these guys.

	* PublishableAdapter
	Base class to help implementing Publishable.

	* ChangeReport, Publishable
	Moved to alp.cluster from alp.ldm.plan.

	* Task
	ChangeReport support for tasks.

2000-05-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlanElementImpl
	Basic ChangeReport collection functionality and an initial
	low-fidelity cut at AllocationResult change reports.

	* PlanElement
	Make Publishable, add pseudo-inner classes implement ChangeReport.

	* AspectType
	Add UNDEFINED value and make comments javadoc complient.

	* Subscriber
	Clear changereports on publishAdd, complain if there are
	outstanding ChangeReports on publishRemove.

	* IncrementalSubscription
	Add Collection-returning accessors for delta lists.

2000-04-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPPlan
	Provide ChangeReport change api for LPs.

	* persist2/BasePersistence
	Tweak for new EnvelopeTuple implementations.

	* ExpanderHelper, AllocatorHelper
	Adjust some helpers to call a more direct change propagation
	method.  For now, the helper methods depend on automatic
	changereport collection.  They may need to provide different
	information at some point.

	* PlugInAdapter, PlugInDelegate
	Convenience methods for accessing the new Subscriber publishChange 
	API.  While plugins could use the Subscriber methods themselves,
	in practice, most will want to use the slightly-more-convenient
	delagating methods here.  In effect, this is the
	"producer-of-change" end of the change propagation API.

	* Subscriber
	Extend publishChange to collect ChangeReports from Publishable
	objects and from an optional extra argument to propagate to change 
	consumers.  

	* CollectionSubscription
	Collect ChangeReports from ChangeEnvelopeTuples and make 'em
	available to subscription clients.  This facility could go
	elsewhere, but this seems to be as good as any.  Other obvious
	choices are either at Subscription (the base class) or at
	IncrementalSubscription.  This is the "consumer-of-change" side of 
	the change propagation API.

	* Subscription, et.al.
	Make the privateChange API take a second argument always.  There
	is no need for a convenience function because this is *very*
	internal. 

	* Envelope, PersistenceEnvelope
	Simplify and delegate more behavior to the EnvelopeTuples. 
	
	* *EnvelopeTuple
	Moved tuple types into separate classes.  Significantly improves
	clarity and probably improves performance by reducing the size of
	a tuple.  Also, each tuple now performs the subscription
	modifications rather than the Envelope doing the job.

	* Publishable, ChangeReport
	Basic new classes for change tracking facility.  Publishable has
	some persistence functionality which I can no longer remember the
	appropriate description of.

2000-04-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LatePropertyProvider, et.al.
	Full support for Late-binding PropertyProviders, Null_PG and
	Future_PG implementations.

	* AssetSkeletonBase, Asset*
	Rewrite of PG resolution.  Much cleaner supporting late binding,
	futures, nulls, simpler prototype relationships.  Not yet
	optimized/tuned.

2000-04-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetWriter
	Support for dealing with Null_PG values and serialization of
	NullPGs and Future_PGs.

	* PGWriter
	All machine-generated PGs build both Future and Null variations.
	FooPG.nullPG holds a static "NullPG" value.  FooPG.Future is
	always a class which implements both FooPG and Future_PG.

	* Future_PG
	Base interface for "Future" PGs: PGs which are temporary
	placeholders for the "real" PG values.  See examples for more
	information. Use of futurePG accessors block until "finalized"
	with a real value.  PlugIns emitting Future_PG instances must
	have their own thread to prevent deadlocks.

	* Null_PG
	Base interface for "Null" PGs: PGs which are more-or-less PG-typed
	empty/illegal values.  Use to distinguish between possibly defined
	PGs (late-bound) and known-to-be-undefined PGs.
	
2000-04-19  Jim Winston <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* MPTaskImpl
	When setParentTasks() is called, if the Context of the MPTask is null,
	the Context of the MPTask is set to the union of the Contexts of the
	parent tasks. Only Contexts that are instances of ContextOfUIDs are included.
	The result is a new ContextOfUIDs that contains one instance of each UID
	contained in the parent tasks' ContextOfUIDs.

2000-04-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Add some convenience methods and tweak semantics slightly - see
	the new documentation.

2000-04-06  Jim Winston	 <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* Policy
	Added setContext() and getContext() methods

2000-03-31  Jim Winston	 <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* ContextOfUIDs
	New class. Implements Context. For use when Context of a task can be referenced
	by UIDs.
	
2000-03-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterObjectFactory
	createDisposition added, but leave createFailedDisposition, both
	for backward compatability and for convenience.	

	* Disposition
	Replace FailedDisposition with Disposition, which may be used both 
	for failure or vacuous success states.  Fixed various other
	classes to match.

2000-03-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlugIn*
	Add a nice little claim/unclaim feature to do the claiming
	gruntwork for you. Remember to check the return value of claim in
	case you happen not to have won the race.

	* Claimable, ClaimableImpl
	add boolean tryClaim method to atomically grab a claim on an object.

	* TimeSpanSet
	Now extend ArrayListFoundation to be sigificantly faster and
	smaller, since we are no longer a wrapper around an ArrayList.
	More improvements await.  Fixed up extending classes.

	* ArrayListFoundation
	Modified version of ArrayList to provide direct access to internal 
	structures for extending classes.	

2000-03-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* version.def
	update to version 6.1, and branched ALP 6.0

	* FailedDisposition
	Better name for FailedAllocation.	

	* alp.ldm.predicate
	New package has a bunch of useful predefined predicates suitable
	both for direct use and for subclassing.

2000-03-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Verb, Role, Preposition
	Move non-core constants to Domain.  See, for example,
	mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.Constants.

2000-03-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.plugin.PlugIn, PlugInContext, et.al.
	Full support for stateless plugins.  See documentation in
	alp.plugin.PlugIn for information.	

	* RoleSchedule, et.al.
	Use Collections API, extends TimeSpanSet.
	Renamed getRoleSchedule to getRoleSheduleElements.
	deprecated all Date-based methods. 
	Simplified implementation.

	* PEBinaryPredicate, StartDateBinaryPredicate
	removed.

	* Collectors
	Remove JGL support.

	* ScheduleImpl
	Correct semantics of getEndTime, getEndDate.

	* Filters
	Some careful optimizations to avoid consing new empty collections, 
	and cheaper operation on lists.

	* ScheduleUtilities
	Rewrite of many old methods.  The rest should also be
	rewritten. addOrSubtractToThisSchedule functionality has been
	moved to addSchedules and subtractSchedules methods.

	* Schedule
	extends Collection to integrate with other Collections.
	extends TimeSpan so you can compare whole schedules or have a
	schedule of schedules.
	addOrSubtractToThisSchedule functionality has been moved to
	ScheduleUtilities.

	* Schedule, ScheduleImpl, ScheduleUtilities, etc
	Schedules are now JDK Collection-based.  All methods with JGL
	arguments or return-values have been removed.  Date-based methods
	are all deprecated in favor of long millis methods.
	SimpleScheduleFoo methods are removed.

2000-03-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.TimeSpanSet
	Basic building block for schedules.  Maintains a sorted list of
	implementations of TimeSpan objects.  Not very efficient right now,
	but the API is pretty much correct and the implementation can be
	fixed with binary instead of sequential searching, some special
	cases for copy and compare, and perhaps doing internal array
	management instead of using an ArrayList for the actual storage.	

	* alp.util.TimeSpan
	Abstraction of objects with a temporal extent.  The generic
	schedule collection will operate on TimeSpan elements.

2000-03-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Annotatable
	Abstraction of plan objects with Annotation.  Decided to simplify
	things with the new interface.

	* Context
	Allow tasks to have a planning context attached.  This is intended 
	to allow, for instance, the Logistics Domain to attach an Oplan ID 
	to tasks to indicate which Oplan the task is supporting.

	* Subscription, et.al.
	Remove JGL from all subscription-related code.  Uses JDK
	Collections Framework instead.

2000-03-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlugInAdapter.query()
	API for future light-weight query of LogPlan.

	* UnaryPredicate
	New class: staging for removal of JGL.

2000-03-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.plugin.Annotation, Task, Workflow, PlanElement
	Allow the constructing plugin to tag certain LDM objects with a
	plugin-specified state object (Annotation).  See Annotation
	for more information.	

	* DomainManager
	Get collections of known domains by name or value.

	* RMINameServer
	Automatically start the nameserver when local and couldn't contact 
	it the first time around.  May be disabled by alp.nameserver.auto=false

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterIdentifier.toString
	no longer puts <> around the name.

	* VersionWriter, MeasureWriter, AssetWriter, PGWriter
	moved to build module, all in the alp.build package.
	Updated .def files appropriately.

	* alp.ldm.policy, alp.ldm.trigger
	Move these packages up a level from alp.ldm.plan.
	Moved Ship and StockageLevel policies to logistics domain.

2000-03-02  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Make sure core doesn't use now moved classes.
	
	* alp.ldm.asset, alp.ldm.plan, alp.ldm.oplan
	Move ALP-specific domain objects to mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.

	* Factory
	Remove all methods from interface.  Implementations are free to
	add whatever methods which are required.  Otherwise, plugins
	should use RootFactory for asset construction.
	
	* Domain
	Change the LogicProvider insertion api to construct the LPs and
	pass them back to the cluster for insertion into the LogPlan
	rather than to require the Domain method to insert them. This
	allows LogPlan.addLogicProvider to not be public.

2000-03-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.plan
	remove FGI-specific domain objects

	* Claimable, ClaimableImpl
	Moved from alp.ldm.plan to alp.cluster.

	* Message
	make Message classes concrete: Impl classes renamed to be the
	primary classes, interfaces dropped.
	
	Moved ClusterMessage, AckDirectiveMessage, DirectiveMessage,
	AdvanceClockMessage to alp.cluster.
	
 	Moved Add/RemovePlugIn to alp.plugin. 

	* alp.ldm.plan.Predicate
	remove redundant class.

	* alp.ldm.asset.AssetIntrospection
	moved from alp.ldm.plan.

	* alp.util.PropertyNameValue
	moved from alp.ldm.plan.

	* alp.util.XMLizer
	renamed alp.ldm.plan.XMLPlanObjectConverter.

	* alp.util.XMLizable
	renamed alp.ldm.plan.XMLPlanObject.	

2000-02-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDMServesClient, ClusterServesPlugIn
	Extends from ClusterContext to reduce redundancy in method specs.
	It would be nice to get rid of some of the extras in ClusterContext.

	* LdmFactory
	Add back a deprecated LdmFactory interface to provide some measure 
	of backward compatability so that we can put off large quantities
	of plugin rewriting a little longer.

2000-02-28  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Manage Domain factories for plugins, interface to Domains, load
	LPs through domains, etc.  This completes the infrastructure part
	of the first cut at Pluggable domains.

	* LDM
	Updates to make use of the below.

	* LDMServesClient
	New base interface for various others to extend with common methods.

	* RootFactory
	Replacement instantiable class for old LdmFactory.  Implements all 
	the required asset functionality including support for additional
	Asset and PG factories.  RootFactory is the LDM factory for the
	Root Domain - see above.

	* Factory
	Base interface API for all LDM Factories.  Just the basics -
	assumes only asset api is available, presumably often via
	delegation.

	* LdmFactory, SelfBeanInfo, LdmObject
	Removed.

	* SelfDescribingBeanInfo
	moved from alp.ldm to alp.util.

2000-02-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Task
	changed getParentTask() to getParentTaskUID().  MPTask and
	Workflow still have parent *tasks* since they don't generally get
	serialized. 

	* Proxiable
	Remove all support for transparent remote Proxy object.  Too
	complicated, too fragile, and far too easy to abuse.

2000-02-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ProxiableSet
	removed - anyone can use UniqueObjectSet instead.

	* UniqueObjectSet
	Generalize ProxiableSet, since Proxiable is going away.

2000-02-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* society
	Remove voyager support.  Broken and buggy and nobody seems
	interested in fixing it.

2000-02-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* scalability, management
	moved packages to tools module.

	* Copyrights
	Updated copyright comments as appropriate.  Any files which have
	< copyright > < /copyright > pairs (without the extra spaces) can
	be updated mechanically in the future.

	* various
	Removed dead code.

	* ClusterIdentifier
	moved from alp to alp.cluster.

	* GenericStateModel*, StateModelException
	moved from alp to alp.util.

	* mil.darpa.log.alp
	Merged m.d.l.a classes into alp.* to prepare for breaking them
	back out into domain packages.  Exceptions:  merged
	m.d.l.a.utilities into alp.util, m.d.l.a.data into alp.ldm.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessageImpl Remove try-catch around deserialization of
	DirectiveMessage. Yes, I know I already did that, but this one is
	in readExternal.

	* DatabasePersistence
	Add logging output to files.

2000-02-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPObject, QoSO, lots-of-others
	Removed ALPObject and QoSO.  Worse than useless: the isValid
	methods look like they should be useful, but the implementations
	are usually wrong and occasionally NPE.

	* AggregationImpl, CompositionImpl
	Fix an infinite recursion in auto-propagate rescind.  Several
	synchronization fixes should close some potential bogons. Don't
	copy collections so gratuitously.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessageImpl
	Remove try-catch around deserialization of the directives. Allow
	the exception to propagate so that the entire DirectiveMessage is
	abandoned instead of being processed with the missing directives.

	* RescindLP
	Disable short-circuiting of rescinds of tasks allocated to
	self. Doing so allows rescinds to get ahead of allocates such that
	rescind finds nothing to rescind and, later, the supposedly
	rescinded task appears.

	* Persistence
	Embed debugging statements in conditionals to reduce consing when
	not debugging.
	Replace references to unpublished plan elements with null instead
	of throwing an exception. This may help with the Aggregator
	problem.

	* Preposition intern all the constants.

	* MessageManager given separate thread for sending ACKs so that
	ACK transmission can held off during epoch advancement. Remove
	epoch numbering.

2000-02-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlugInAdapter, *PlugIn
	All plugin classes can now select their threading model at load
	time.  The whole API is in PlugInAdapter and all the basic
	subclasses have be greatly simplified to take advantage by
	choosing whichever threading model they wish.  Provisions are made 
	to allow a plugin to implement its own threading model, but a
	pretty good range is supplied (NONE, ONESHOT, SINGLE, SHARED).
	All defaults are consistent - no source changes (or recompiles!)
	are required.  The old base classes will probably be deprecated
	for ALP 6.0 just to re-simplify the choice of base class.  
	Also, the SINGLE threading model has new options to lower the
	priority and/or stop the explicit post-cycle() yield.

2000-02-11  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Expose the database connection through the ClusterServersPlugIn
	API so plugins can use the same database transaction as
	persistence.

	* Add database version of persistence storing deltas in database
	table "long raw" column.

2000-02-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Remove support for -Dalp.traceAssets.

2000-02-10  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Add StringUtility.appendArray(StringBuffer buf, Object[] array)
	to append the string representation of an array to a StringBuffer.

	* Add StringUtility.arrayToString(Object[]) to form a string
	representation of an array of the form "[<item>,<item>,...]" where
	each <item> is the toString() value of the objects in the array.

	* Reinstate sequence number transport in messages. This is
	essential for correct operation of persistence. Also remove
	epochid and contents. These are not being used.

	* Change DirectiveMessage to hold an array of directives instead
	of just one. Fill one directive message for each destination with
	the directives that result from all the transactions handled by
	the logplan in one cycle. This insures that the effect of the
	directives will enter the destination logplan in a single
	transaction. Plugins can take advantage of this by knowing that
	every change made by one plugin in one transaction will appear in
	one transaction of another plugin even if the second plugin is in
	another cluster.

2000-02-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskScoreTable, ExpansionImpl
	Re-implement TaskScoreTable as a simplified closed HashTable. 
	There's a terrible inefficiency somewhere in here: the
	TaskScoreTable is recreated each time something changes, and then
	the expansion's SubTaskResult list is *also* recreated each time
	it is asked for.  We need to re-examine the whole partial-results
	logic.
	
2000-02-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PingNameServer
	A utility for testing NameServer functionality.

2000-02-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Node
	Disable Application server support for now.
	Add VM and OS information on startup.  Make Cluster loading
	process nicer.

2000-02-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMI*, Communications, etc
	Cut over to a full-RMI system.  It should be pretty easy now that
	it is properly generalized, to make the Voyager stuff work again.
	Updates to management console to work with the new mechanism are
	still in progress.  Otherwise, everything else is functional.
	
	* NameServer, RMINameServer, et.al.
	Extended NameServer api to extend Java Collections Map api.  Added 
	functionality to support a directory structure on top of
	traditional Map interface.

2000-02-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Parameters
	ALP parameter utility for doing various sorts of string
	substitution based on the calling environment.

2000-01-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TriggerManagerPlugIn
	Adjust logic slightly. make it a fat plugin. 
	Add alp.trigger.verbosity=0.  Set =2 to print progress notes.  
	Add alp.trigger.minWait=1000 to set minimum wait pause time.

	* PeriodicAlarm, Timer
	Add support for non-terminating, periodic alarms.
	Also, timer always waits at least 0.1 seconds between alarms to
	make sure that it doesn't run all out.  This is particularly
	important since otherwise periodic alarms can be written to cause
	severe damage.

	* RMINameserver, RMIMessageTransport
	Add alp.nameserver.verbosity parameter.  If 0 (default),
	nameservice reports are very quiet. if 1, stackdumps on errors.
	If 2, progress reports and stack dumps.

2000-01-28  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* UID
	Adjust uid comparison a bit.  Shouldn't be functionally different
	but is probably slightly faster.

	* PlanElementImpl
	wire in reality plan.  Update beaninfo here and for directive to
	not publish plan.

	* Node
	First create all the clusters, then populate them with plugins.
	Prevents needing to queue messages for forward-referenced clusters 
	in the same node.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Check earlier in the chain for intra-node delivery options to
	avoid incurring the inQ/outQ overhead.

	* RoleScheduleImpl
	Reuse PEBinaryPredicate instance.  Optimize predicates so as not
	to defeat memoization of aspect value accessors.
	
	* PEBinaryPredicate
	make just one instance to be reused, for instance by
	RoleScheduleImpl. Also optimize.		

	* TaskImpl
	Make UID non-transient: we're spending too much time recomputing
	'em.

	* DirectiveImpl
	Wire in RealityPlan to save a cell and some serialization cost.

	* PlanImpl, ClusterObjectFactory
	Make realityPlan a static.

	* ClusterImpl
	Turn off the showProgress newline generation, as it doesn't help
	readability and adds a moderately contended lock.

	* ReceiveNotificationLP, NotificationLP
	send intra-cluster notifications via direct-call rather than
	actually creating a notification and a directive message and then
	sending it through the message transport.  This should be a big
	improvement for busy multi-level clusters - e.g. those with
	several cooperating plugins.

	* Verb
	Adjust equals methods: 
	equals(String) checks for == before equals and no longer interns
	the argument to optimize the most common case.
	equals(Object) checks for == and includes string equality for
	consistency. 

2000-01-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Extend fallback mode timeouts for large, slow societies.

	* ClusterObjectFactoryImpl
	Stop registering proxiables.  Nobody should care, anyway.

	* LaborScheduleImpl
	Partial rewrite.  Keeps combined schedule around instead of
	recomputing each time it is needed. Some improvements in
	computation of combined schedule. Thunk operations work on
	combined schedule instead of bogus set.

	* QuantityScheduleElement
	SumQuantities utility Thunk.

	* ScheduleUtilities
	Minor optimizations and a bunch of Thunk-based utility methods.

	* Thunk
	Add some utility thunk classes: Counter and Collector


	* ScheduleUtilities
	Move to alp.ldm.plan from alp.ldm.plan, leaving a
	deprecated shell behind.

2000-01-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Detect old Admin node or multiple message clients with the same
	name. Add alp.message.decacheFailureLimit parameter, show
	exceptions on transport errors while tracing is turned on,
	printing them to log (.cml) files.		

2000-01-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Equals for assets is defined as being exactly the same class and
	having equals TypeIdentification and ItemIdentification codes. 
	
	* AggregateAssetAdapter
	Equals for aggregate assets is defined as having the same quantity
	of the same (equals) asset.  TID and IID are ignored.
	
	* MessageTransport, Citizen
	Generalize the MessageTransport selection code.  Simplest option
	is to set system property alp.message.transport to the short name
	of the transport.  Example:
		-Dalp.message.transport=RMI
	Currently valid values are "RMI" (the default), "Voyager" and "Pipe".
	alp.message.transportClass property still works and overrides the above.

	* Citizen
	Make RMI the default transport/nameserver.

	* RMINameServer
	add system property alp.nameserver.verbose=false.  Iff true, will
	report non-fatal namespace exceptions, otherwise will print "!" to 
	err each time.

2000-01-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Add -Dalp.traceAssets=true flag to enable reporting of Asset
	prototype transfers.

	* AssetWriter
	Change some casting so that failed prototype transfer wont cause
	class cast exceptions.

2000-01-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.society.rmi.*
	Slightly hacked first cut at an RMI-based MessageTransport and
	NameServer.  Still requires the voyager-based FdsRegistry code for 
	compatibility with PSPs, management console, etc.  Turned on with 
	-Dalp.message.transportClass=alp.society.rmi.RMIMessageTransport

2000-01-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Make fallbackCount default to 10 (>50 seconds). 
	Add decacheFailureLimit parameter - simply retries sends this many 
	times (forever if 0) before forcing another namespace lookup.
	DestinationQueues will now discover local clients instead of
	relying on voyager for forward-referenced (local) destinations.

	* FdsRegistry
	Change MulticastAddress lookup to not take a prefix to reduce
	String consing.

	* DirectiveMessage, et.al.
	Make DirectiveMessages faster to serialize.

	* ClusterIdentifier, MessageAddress
	Make lighter-weight and fast to serialize.

	* alp.util.FastString
	String wrapper class for fast (CPU-wise) serialization of strings.
	You can turn off use of this with -Dalp.message.useFastString=false.

2000-01-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RoleSchedule, et.al.
	Maintain RoleSchedule at publish boundaries rather than at
	allocation and LP time. 

	* MessageTransport, PipedMessageTransport
	Performance improvements for debugging.  Also make the default for 
	alwaysSerialize actually not serialize loopback messages
	(e.g. cluster to itself).  This is more like what
	VoyagerMessageTransport does, though it contradicts
	"alwaysSerialize".  Use alp.message.useLocalDelivery=false to
	restore to the previous behavior.  Also implements a deadletter
	box for messages directed to clusters which do not yet exist -
	this box is traversed whenever a new cluster is added so that
	forward references work without forever looping on clusters which
	will never exist.

	* ReceiveNotificationLP
	More useful debug message when we get an unhandle-able notification.

	* TaskProxyImpl
	Dump stack whenever some loser dereferences a taskProxy.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Enter a slow-retry fallback mode after 5 consecutive message
	failures.  See javadoc for more info.

2000-01-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.StringKey, alp.cluster.*Set
	Use StringKey to avoid recomputing string hashCodes bazillions of times.

	* SharedPlugInManager
	Better scheduler: the more recently a plugin ran, the lower it's
	priority in the queue.

	* Various
	Initialize HashMaps to non-default, reasonable, prime sizes.

	* UID, MessageAddress
	Cache the hashcode, so as not to recompute based on the string
	each lookup.

	* AllocationResult
	Include aux queries in isEquals test.  TOPS request.

	* TaskImpl
	Indicate how many auxqueries present during tostring.  Any more
	information is up to the caller.  TOPS request.

	* RoleScheduleImpl
	Use correct predicates throughout, based on those in
	SchedulePredicate.  More documentation, cleanup. SRA request.

	* SchedulePredicate
	Fix some end-time checks, document. SRA request.

1999-12-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AspectValue
	Add equals(Object) and hashCode methods.

1999-12-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Faster and more fair incoming message queuing.

	* TaskImpl, ClusterMessageImpl
	More useful toString methods

	* FdsRegistry
	Reduce the time spent in synchronized code when the code is going
	to have to timeout/fail.

1999-12-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AspectValue
	catch setting the value to NaN.

1999-12-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlanElement, et.al.
	Make plan elements self-describing beans, not exposing the
	conflict methods.

	* Schedule, et.al.
	Update docs and implementations to reflect closed-start/open-end
	of scheduleElement time span definition.

1999-12-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ScalabilityManager
	resolve some slightly ambiguous method references.
	
	* ReceiveNotificationLP, ExpansionImpl, TaskScoreTable
	Much faster maintenance of expansion subtask results.  Includes
	api additions to supporting objects.

	* Verb, UID, PrepositionalPhraseImpl, TaskImpl
	Optimize critical equality tests with == when appropriate.
	
	* RescindLP
	Disable conflict flagging code - see yesterday's log below for
	info.

1999-11-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SimplifiedFatPlugIn
	New plugin base class like SimplifiedPlugIn except has a thread of 
	its own.

	* ClusterImpl, AllocationImpl, AssetTransferImpl
	Disconnected RoleScheduleConflictLP and have accessors throw
	exceptions if/when called.  Computation of the Conflicts was a
	cpu hog, and since nobody actually uses the information...

	* Oplan, et.al.
	Oplan.clone() now does a deep copy of the components, so that we
	don't share detailed state within a node (and miss change
	reports). should fix a bug noticed by TASC.

	* ClusterImpl
	Property alp.cluster.trafficPeriod, defaulting to 80, indicates
	how many traffic characters to print to stdout before adding a
	newline.  If <= 0, no newlines will be printed.

1999-11-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SingleThreadedPlugIn, SharedPlugInManager
	name Threads.

	* ClusterImpl
	print \n after every 10 status chars.

	* Schedule, ScheduleImpl
	Accessor for Thunk application.

	* Thunk, Collectors
	Abstract and cheap iteration over set-like objects.

	* Envelope
	avoid consing iterators in inner loop of transaction opens.  Small 
	but significant overhead because these points are exercised so
	often. Small additional gains could be had by using a simpler
	implementation of List - for instance one that doesn't do bounds
	checking on each get(int) or one that exposes the internal array
	on demand.

	* Asset
	Increase efficiency of setPropertyGroup(), which used some
	expensive and uncached introspection to do its thing.  Now uses
	less expensive introspection and caches its results in a static.
	Requires the PropertyGroup changes below.  Also removed some old
	debugging code and supplied reasonable initial sizes for
	hashset/hashmaps.

	* PropertyGroup, *PG, PGWriter
	add getters so that we can avoid introspecting to find the
	asset.setFoo method names in Asset.

1999-11-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* management
	Reduce Date and string consing.

	* PGWriter
	Consistency on statics in generated interface code.

	* Subscriber
	reduce consing of empty iterators.

	
1999-11-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Minor cleanup. Added alp.cluster.showTraffic=false to turn off the 
	message sent/received characters (+/-).		

	* TriggerManagerPlugIn
	Rewrite to clean up the control flow.  Simpler, uses the below
	changes to be smarter about redundant alarms and proper time to
	sleep. Never goes to sleep for less than 1sec, though it can still 
	be wake()ed by logplan changes.

	* PlugInAdapter.PlugInAlarm
	Added a toString() method to PlugInAlarm so that the verbose modde 
	of Timer is actually slightly useful.

	* Alarm, PlugInAdapter, Timer, ScenarioTimer
	Added Alarm.cancel() method.

	* TriggerTimeBasedMonitor
	Use system time consistently.  Add getRemainingTime method to use
	in deciding how long to wait.

	* Trigger
	Move call to IndicateRan to end of execute, so that we time-based
	triggers that take a while to execute don't end up running
	constantly. 

	* PlugInAdapter
	New sanity checks on wake* calls.  Complains when the wake times
	requested are already past.

	* Timer
	Add some debugging options:
		alp.timer=quiet		no output
		alp.timer=visible	asterix on each alarm
		alp.timer=verbose	timer and alarm printed each alarm
	quiet is the current default.  A current concern is that alarms
	are being set to go off very rapidly or lots of alarms set to go
	off in the past.  If these turn out to be happening, we'll have to
	implement a minimum wait time.
	

1999-11-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ForcePackage
	update .equals() to not NPE on empty ForcePackageID.

	* AllocationResult
	Attempt to fix significant redundant cloning of number arrays -
	mostly reduced time and temporary-object consing.  Really needs a
	full rewrite with an eye towards efficiency AND safety.

	* PreferenceChangeLP, TaskImpl
	Better version of hack to fix comodification errors in
	PreferenceChangeLP. 

1999-11-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	PluginLoader semantics are too complicated for people in crunch
	mode.  Default is now to use *only* classpath to load classes.
	-Dalp.cluster.pluginloader=true will turn the plugin loader back
	on. 

	* ReceiveTransferableLP
	Reconcile incoming Oplans with the logplan, add/remove/change
	subordinate objects (OplanContributors) as needed.

	* Oplan, et.al.
	Make ForcePackage, OrgRelation and OrgActivity subordinate object
	to Oplan. Various Oplan objects now support equals()

	* Translations
	utility class for translating between different java object holder 
	implementations.  E.g. Enumeration to Collection, etc.

1999-11-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Break out static code from AssetSkeleton for several reasons:
		a. PGWriter no longer has to write it.
		b. simplify modifying the static stuff.
	Taking advantage of the latter point, it now does lazy
	otherProperties construction, now uses an ArrayList instead of a
	Vector, and it smarter about sets, etc.  Result is lower memory
	load, may be slightly faster too.  Basis for correcting some
	long-standing awkwardnesses - stay tuned.

	* LdmFactory, ClusterObjectFactoryImpl, etc
	LDMFactory and related classes now use the plugin classloader to
	find classes at runtime instead of Class.forName.  This should
	allow creation of policy objects, and non-standard assets and pgs 
	from plugins loaded with the plugin classloader, e.g. from plugins 
	not in classpath.	

1999-11-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.CircularQueue
	New utility collection which implements an efficient circular
	queue of objects.  Used in MessageTransport et al as a much
	lighter-weight message-passing object insulating the various
	threads from each other.  Replaces JGL queue and Collection
	LinkedList uses.  Reduces consing of short-lived objects since
	both old cases allocate element holders, whereas CircularQueue
	just uses an array of Object as backing store.  See javadoc for
	more details.

	* PGs
	Removed confusing empty PGs: OrganizationPropertyGroups,
	OrganizationTypePropertyGroups, MilitaryOrganizationPG,
	NonMilitaryFederalOrganizationPG, StateAndLocalOrganizationPG,
	CommercialOrganizationPG, ForeignMilitaryOrganizationPG,
	ForeignGovernmentalOrganizationPG.  Changed MilitaryOrganization
	asset to have a default slot of MilitaryOrgPG rather than the (now
	removed) MilitaryOrganizationPG.

1999-11-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CapacityScheduleElement
	New type of ScheduleElement with a Capacity as the stored value
	per SE.

	* ProxyQueryTable
	Moved proxy query handler to new file from clusterImpl,
	cleaned/rewrote, removed lots of old/broken stuff. Also fixed a
	bug which prevented proxy queries from actually working at all.

1999-11-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SchedulePredicate
	Change to use longs instead of Dates.

	* TriggerManagerPlugIn
	set minimum interval for timer-based triggers to 1000ms.

	* TaskImpl, ScheduleElement
	Make smaller in-memory and serialization footprints.
	ScheduleElement ordering should be faster, too.

	* ObjectInputStreamWithContext
	use resolveObject to support re-uniquing object after
	serialization.  Intern short strings on deserialization, also
	"intern" Service, Role, Verb and CIDs.

1999-11-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OPlan various
	Fix beaninfo for several classes which declared a
	PropertyDescriptor array larger than the set of properties
	actually filled in.

	* PipedMessageTransport
	implement an optional byte counter for the pipe to track the sizes
	of messages.

1999-11-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ArgTable (Node)
	Allow simplified arguments to Node.  Assume that a
	non-dash-prefixed argument is the Node name ("Foo" is like "-n
	Foo").  Also, a name of "admin" or "Administrator" sets the
	defaults to be what the node scripts have been setting.
	Should be completely backward-compatible.

	* Preposition
	add MAINTAINING

	* LaborScheduleImpl, ScheduleImpl
	Rearrange synchronization to allow LSI schedules to be modified.
	Also reduces copy operations.

	* *PG
	Fix beaninfo indexed collection getters to handle unset (null)
	collections without generating invocation errors.

1999-11-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ContainPG
	Added IsPrepositioned boolean slot.  Used to specify that a cargo
	vehicle is designated as holding prepo.  This implies that it will
	be full of prepo cargo at the start of an operation.

	* Asset, etc
	Changed serialization of Asset prototypes.  Here's the new
	algorithm:
	If Cluster A is sending Asset Q with Prototype P to Cluster B:

	In A (serialization), while encoding Q, if P has already been sent
	to B, send only the TypeIdentification (TID) of P, else send the
	whole object, noting first that we've sent it at least once to
	B. Send only null if P is null.    
	
	In B (deserialization), while decoding Q, if P is sent as a TID,
	look up the TID in B's LDM.  If we fail, construct P as a plain
	Asset, expose to local PropertyProviders, and cache P, using the
	new P instance as Q's prototype.  If P is sent as an asset, check
	B's LDM.  If found, drop the serialized P on the floor and use the 
	local prototype, otherwise expose the prototype to the local B
	PropertyProviders, cache it and continue.

	This should be stable with persistence, resulting only in
	redundant sends of the prototypes by A to B after A is
	reconstructed. 

	* Container
	add ScheduledContentPG to Container (TOPS reqest)
	
	* Package
	New Asset class. Like Container, but for temporary items like
	pallets, et al.


1999-11-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	If while deserializing there is no prototype provider in the
	current cluster for the instance's prototype asset, we'll create
	one, expose it to propertyproviders and cache it for later.

	* PlugInAdapter
	Use RealTime alarms for RealTime variations of wake*.  The
	previous wake* methods are still scenario time.  Timer needs for
	throttling computation, batching, etc, should be better served by
	the RealTime methods.

	All wake* methods now return the alarm instance actually set.
	This allows callers to use Alarm.hasExpired() to test to see if
	that particular alarm has rung, regardless of if the they missed
	the wake or not.

	* Alarm
	Added hasExpired() method.

	* Timer, ScenarioTimer
	Split Timer into two classes, one for realtime, the other for 
	scenario time.

	* ClusterImpl, ClusterServesPlugIn
	Expose RealTime timers to plugins (and implement them).

	* FDSRegistry
	Pass more lookup exceptions through to caller so that the caller
	can determine the best course of action.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Respond loudly to serious lookup problems (e.g. host not found).
	Also, more isLogging support for destination-queues.

1999-11-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* measures.def
	Changed common unit of Duration to hours and Mass to short_tons.
	SRA request.

	* PGs
	Another attempt to get the beaninfo for collection types correct.
	It is unfortunate that java doesn't allow any form of casting from
	Object[] to Foo[].

1999-11-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlugInLoader
	Replaced PlugInClassLoader with PlugInLoader.  PIL is a single
	facility which uses URLClassLoader to extend the directories used
	to load plugin classes to .../lib/*, .../plugins/* and
	.../<product>/lib/* where "*" is any *.{jar,zip,plugin}.  This
	implementation doesn't actually use a security manager, but
	does verify loaded plugin class certificates.  See
	doc/details/Security.txt for further information.  Does not
	restrict plugins from referencing each other.

	* KeyRing
	Move keystore functionality from SignedMessageSecurityManager to
	KeyRing to be used by multiple places.  A side effect is that the
	system properties used to control have changed slightly.
	doc/details/Security.txt has further information.
	

1999-10-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Be a little louder when Voyager times out or otherwise fails to
	deliver a message.

	* FdsRegistry
	Rework of threading and synchronization.  Several potential
	deadlocks removed.  Much lower lock contention, particularly for
	PSP use which can stress the registry's reentrant properties.
	Many fewer network operations while holding locks.  No longer have 
	synchronized methods - instead have two guard locks to separate
	the two major sync usage bodies.  Intended functionality should be 
	unchanged - just more stable and perhaps slightly faster. Old
	version is retained (temporarily) in FdsRegistry.old.

1999-10-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp/ldm/assets/(various)
	Merged in Tops deltas.  Mostly changes to TransportationNetwork
	assets and PGs.

	* AssetWriter
	Removed redundant beaninfo slots, since we chain upwards to get
	the info.  Doesn't actually change visible behavior, since bean
	introspector eliminates duplicates.

	* PositionImpl et al
	fixed clone methods to work without lat/lon defined.  No need to
	construct new lat/lon objects since they are immutable.

1999-10-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Skill
	added parser-based constructors which take a string of
	"/"-separated values.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Fixed multicast messages for destination queues.
	Also wait 5 seconds instead of 5ms before recycling an idle
	message delivery queue

	Also cleaned house - removed some dead code, updated
	documentation, adjusted system property use.
	
	* SharedPlugInManager
	Try and catch errors.  Many JITs will remain trashed, however, so
	you'll have to run interpreted if you get this.

1999-10-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CSSCapability
	Added CSSCapability(String) constructor.  In conjunction with the
	below should allow .ini file parsers to build CSSCapability
	objects.  See javadoc for examples and more info.
 	
	Added equals and hashcode.

	* alp.ldm.measure
	Added Count back in (was commented out for some reason).  Also
	made sure that the default unit for all measures (index 0) is
	the metric base unit wherever possible.
	
	String constructors for measures now can take both things like:
	"123 grams" and "123.0grams".

	Added Test class as a point test.

	new measure.getCommonUnit() returns a commonly-used unit.
	generally, the unit returned is the one most often used by
	military logistics planners for transportation purposes.

	new measure.getUnitName(int) returns the name of the unit
	specified.

	Added equals and hashCode to Capacity.

	Added Capacity(String) constructor which uses reflection to parse
	the argument.

	Made "units" the default unit for Count, keeping eaches as an
	alias.

	Extended point test to ping Capacity parser.
	
1999-10-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClaimableImpl
	Rewritten to use PrivilegedClaimant instead of special cases.
	Adjusted to make sure that all claims warnings really are warnings 
	rather than enforced reports.
	Added system property alp.cluster.claim.isLoud.  Only prints stack 
	traces when set to true, otherwise will be quieter and remind the
	user about isLoud on the first report.

	* PrivilegedClaimant
	New Class generalizes the privileged access to claimable objects
	that were previously only available to Assessors and core internal
	objects (e.g. LogPlan).  Read the javadoc before using it!


	* alp.test.IntrospectionTest
	Test fixture for beans introspection of any class.

	* Role
	BeanInfo added.

	* alp.ldm.asset.*
	New beans introspection mechanism.  Each asset and PG supplies
	beaninfo directly instead of relying on extra BeanInfo classes.
	PG Collections are now supported and lockedPGs are better
	supported with simpler special-casing.  This should be 100%
	backward compatible, possibly modulo client handling of new
	facilities.  Do not compile this set on top of an existing class
	hierarchy - many classes (BeanInfo) are no longer generated, so
	you'll have problems if you mix old .classes with new code.

1999-10-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* FdsRegistry
	Quiet debug messages, turn off explicit GC as a major runtime
	lose, especially for demos.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Rewrite Multicast delivery to take advantage of
	QueuedMessageDelivery. Also somewhat cleaner logic flow.

	* FdsRegistry
	Repair multicast message target lookup so that time propagation
	works again.

	* MilitaryOrgPG
	added home_location slot as a quicker access to org's geoloc.

	* PGBeanInfo
	Changed PGWriter to write better BeanInfo defs:
	1. Fixed bug with method-like properties by no-longer having
	beaninfo representations for those "slots".
	2. Added support of Collection-typed slots as IndexedProperties.

1999-09-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.asset.CSSCapabilityPG
	Has a list of CSSCapability objects.

	* alp.ldm.plan.CSSCapability
	Has a capability "type" like "MOS/43B" or "FuelTransport" and a
	Capacity like "88 hours per day" or "1000 gallons per minute".
	
	* alp.ldm.measure.Capacity
	New Measure class has a scalar numerator and a duration
	denominator. Can also support "instantaneous" Capacity with
	unspecified duration.  CSS support.

	* alp.ldm.measure.Scalar
	New Measure class is a superclass of various scalar measures
	like Mass, Volume, Distance and Duration.  Prerequisite for CSS
	support.
	
	* alp.ldm.measure.Count
	Resurrected count for CSS support.

	* SignedMessageSecurityManager
	Implemented a real MSM (loosely) based on BBN Columbia's IA
	wizards.  Signs messages and depends on local (config)
	availability of public keys.  See doc/details for the whole story
	with all the details of the demo implementation.

1999-09-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MessageSecurityManager
	Initial interfaces for MSM, along with a SecureMessage ifc and
	vacuous impls in DummyMessageSecurityManager.

1999-09-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlugInClassLoader
	Quiet warning (PLUGIN directory missing) since nobody, including
	alpine, is building "correct" plugins. Also make it work properly
	under windows, since zip entries do not get their names translated 
	between '/' and '\\'.  sigh.

	* alp.util.Sortings
	Extensions to Collection.sort include non-destructive sorting,
	sorting of any Collection type, and use of element keys
	(Mapping). Example: you can get a copy of a list of people sorted
	by name with something like:
		Collection byName = Sortings.sort(people, alphabeticCompare, mapName);
	where alphabeticCompare is a comparator and mapName is a Mapping
	which returns the name of a person.  The result will be a new
	list containing the people of the original list, sorted by name.
	
1999-09-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* assets
	More adjustment of ERQ support (as negotiated with ICIS).
	yesterdays support dumped:
	  - removed VolumetricStorageTank, FuelTank
	  - changed VolumetricERQPG to VolumetricStockagePG
	current support:
	- new asset classes:
	  - Inventory isa Asset, hasa ScheduledContentPG
	  - VolumetricInventory isa Inventory, hasa VolumetricStockagePG
	- new VolumetricStockagePG
	  - has reorder_level, min_reorder_volume and unobtainable volumes
	It would be nice if we had a Quantity/Quantized measure so that
	we could support multiple measures of stockage parameters with one
	Inventory Asset and one StockagePG.  Maybe next year.

	* Skill
	Added a bunch of Predicates selecting for various skill types.
	see additional notes in today's ChangeLog entries below.

	* Person
	Simplified Person hierarchy:
	- only two classes of Person, all others removed.
	  - Person: has PersonPG
	  - MilitaryPerson: has MilitaryPersonPG and AssignmentPG
	- only two classeses of Person PGs, all others removed.
	  - PersonPG: replaces PersonIDPG, adds a Collection of Skills
	  - MilitaryPersonPG: unchanged.
	Note: the alp.util.Filters utility class will be helpful for
	anyone who wants to search the skills set for particular skill
	codes, types, etc.  For example, to find a Person's MOS:
		Collection skills = person.getPersonPG().getSkills();
		Skill mos = Filters.findElement(skills, Skill.mosP);
	
	* Skill
	New generic representation of personal Skills used by PersonPG.
	Most skills are represented by the Skill class: e.g. the MOS 11B
	might be constructed as:
		new Skill("MOS","11B","Infantryman");  // prints as "MOS/11B"
	Also an extension of Skill is AircrewSkill:
		new AircrewSkill("C-17", "Pilot", "AirRefueling", "A1", true);
	(which prints as "Aircrew/Pilot").
	Skill defines a bunch of Predicates which test for various common
	skill types (e.g. MOS).
	
1999-09-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* assets
	remove "old=" lines from PG defs.
	Support for ERQ (requested by ICIS).
	- new assets: 
	  - VolumetricStorageTank which is a major end item similar
	  to a container except it stores liquids and has a
	  VolumetricERQPG. 
	  - FuelTank which is a vacuous subclass of the above.
	- new PG:
	  - VolumetricERQPG which represents EconomicReorderQuantity.
	
	* Measures
	New constructors:
	- Measure(double, int) is like newMeasure(double, int).
	- Measure(String) takes strings like "number unit" where number is 
	any kind of parsable double representation and unit is a valid
	(full) unit name - any mix of case is accepted.  E.g. "47.3 pounds"		

	* Composition
	Require that the combinedTask be an MP task at compile time.

	* alp.util
	Various classes that should have been part of the JDK Collections
	framework:
	- Predicate:  Similar to the JGL UnaryPredicate.
	- Filters:  Predicate-based subsetting of Collections.
	- Mapping:  Predicate-like functional object transformer.
	- Mappings:  Mapping-based Collection transformation.

1999-09-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskProxyImpl
	removed deprecated getID().  use getKey().

	* TaskImpl
	removed deprecated getID().  use getKey().
	
	* ConfigFileFinder
	removed deprecated locate(String).  Use an open method.

	* PlugInAdapter
	removed deprecated getComponent().  Use getCluster().
	removed deprecated wake(long).  Use wakeAfter(long).

	* EssentialPlugin
	removed deprecated withSubscriptionLock().  Use open/closeTransaction().

	* ClusterObjectFactory
	removed deprecated createAssetTransfer w/out Role argument.  Use
	method with Role argument.
	removed deprecated createAllocation w/out Role argument.  Use
	method with Role argument.
	deprecated getVerb(String). Use Verb constructor.

	* OrganizationAdapter
	removed deprecated getPredictor.  Use getClusterPG().getPredictor()
	removed deprecated setPredictor.  Use getClusterPG().setPredictor()
	
	* Asset
	removed deprecated removeATRoleSchedule().  Use getRoleSchedule().removeATRoleSchedule()  

1999-09-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DefaultPrototypeProviderPlugIn
	disable it by not loading by default.  If someone needs it, it
	can still be loaded in cluster config files.

	* PGWriter
	Added getFooHandler accessors so that one could tell if there is
	a value handler installed without requiring a try/catch.  Also
	made it all compilable with javac.  Javac bug reported to Javasoft.

1999-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset*BeanInfo
	New generated BeanInfo classes parallel the asset tree and
	recursively find all the properties.  Added some BeanInfo classes
	for non-generated adapter and special asset classes.

	* AssetConsumptionRatePG
	New PG with computed slot for adding Consumption rates to assets.
  	Added to asset tree as a required PG at ClassVIIMajorEndItem.
	(requested by ICIS) 

	* NewPrepositionalPhrase.setIndirectObject(Object)
	method added for most-general case. (requested by TOPS)

1999-09-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetConsumptionRate
	Corrected package.  Was alp.ldm.asset, now alp.ldm.plan.

1999-09-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFileFinder
	Strongly deprecate locate() method which finds a File, add a new
	method open() which returns an InputStream.  New functionality
	(open) does the same old thing with raw (relative) file names by
	default, but can also retrieve files using a variety of other
	methods: ftp, http and file.  When the property alp.config.server
	is set with node's -cs argument, it should be a prefix to a
	configuration server directory
	(e.g. "http://config.alp.org/"). when the property alp.config is 
	set with node's -config argument, it is appended to the cs url
	(e.g. "minitestconfig").  
	See alp/doc/details/ConfigurationServer.txt for details.
	

	* alpine.society.*
	Support for ConfigurationServer. Added -cs option to set the
	configuration server URL. Added -ns option to set the name server
	string, in place of using alpreg.ini.
 	
	
	

1999-09-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Subscriptions
	Subscription communication is now keyed solely on subscription
	instance, rather than predicate.  This eliminated ambiguity in
	cases where there are multiple subscriptions with the same
	predicate. the subscribe(UnaryPredicate) pattern is now removed
	completely.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	All Messages with the same destination are queued together.  Each
	queue is emptied by its' own thread with is started on demand and
	stopped when idle for long enough.  Should reduce maximum thread
	load in general, and result in much lower overall thread-system
	contention. Also fewer simulateous connection attempts per
	cluster, since multiple messages to X from Y will be delivered
	serially instead of attempting it all at the same time.

	* asset.*
	Machine-generate BeanInfo classes for Assets.

	* AssetConsumptionRate
	FCR-like interface.  Still needs a PG to hook everything up.

1999-08-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Timer
	Timer had used TreeSet to keep the alarms in the right
	order. Unfortunately, TreeSet assumes that equal ordering == equal 
	objects (seems pretty bogus to me).  This meant that you couldn't
	have two different alarms set to go off at the same time.  Now we
	use arrayList and a custom insert to keep the order right.  We
	still use a comparator so when sun fixes things, we can go back to 
	a better implementation.

1999-08-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogicProvider et al
	Eliminate test() method as requiring redundant processing - just
	call execute() and let it decide if it can handle it or not.
	Simplified API of helper functions by moving them to
	EnvelopeTuple. Did some general cleanup of LPs while porting them
	to new api.

	* task.getPlanElement
	Maintain task.getPlanElement at publish* boundaries. Had been
	doing adds at PE construction time and removes at (un)claim time.
	
	* LogicProvider
	Use LdmFactory instead of ClusterObjectFactory.

	* Asset*
	Separate the concepts of copying an asset ("I have a new truck
	just like this other one except, of course, with a different VIN
	and bumper number") and subset-cloning an asset ("This is a
	representation of this same asset with only the subset of its
	capabilities I allow to to use").  The former is available via
	LdmFactory.copyInstance(Asset) and the latter via
	LdmFactory.cloneInstance(Asset).  See documentation for details.
	Asset.copy() should no longer be used.

1999-08-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetTransfer
	Change an AssetTransfer and an update message is sent, which can
	update the available schedule and a handful of asset properties:
	ClusterPG, OrganizationPG, AssignedPG.  This allows serving
	cluster, predictor, and available roles to be updated as needed.
	Beware, though of trying to use predictors to represent dynamic
	state - you'll just flood the society with useless messages.

	* Asset/PGWriter
	Asset.set*PG now all take simply PropertyGroup as an argument.
	Should greatly simplify reflective data plugins.  Old "NewFooPG"
	requirement was leftover from an ancient requirement.

1999-08-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrganizationAdapter
	Use ClusterPG as real storage for ClusterID and Predictor.

1999-08-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM
	Major Rework of Properties for OpenSource release.
	In general:
	 Property and Capability suffixes changed to "PG".
	 Organization asset hierarchy simplified.
	 Removed some deadwood.
	
	* PGWriter
 	(was PropertyWriter) produces a perl script (updateLDM.pl)
	to convert between old and new propertygroups and a
	Properties.index which has an alphabetically-sorted list of
	property groups with documentation and slots along with a 
	permuted index of property slots.
	updateLDM.pl and Properties.index should be copied to the
	alp/doc/ReleaseNotes tree prior to each release.

	* properties.def
	Added TOPS-requested property changes, as modified by the above
	changes. 
	
1999-08-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM
	Removed lots of deprecated and stale code, including old OPlan
	implementation.
	
	* measures
	Lots of minor changes.  New Energy class, better Power definition.
	removed Count.

	* Verb
	alp.ldm.plan.Verb is now a real class

	* Role
	Expanded implementation

	* MOS
	New MOS object - patterned on Verb

1999-08-02  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM.getPrototype
	Add an optional second argument, an Asset class hint as to what
	type of Asset you are asking for.  If specified, any returned
	Asset should be instanceof the specified class - that is, an
	instance of that Asset class or a Subclass.  If not specified,
	PropertyProviders must still check and see if they know about the
	specified typeid.

	* PrototypeProvider
	changed getPrototype to take a required second argument - the
	Asset Class being looked for.  See documentation and above for
	information.  While this is an incompatible change, it is better
	than the alternative: adding yet another LDMPI class and method
	signature. 

	* Citizen
	Rename "shortCircuit" option to less deceptive name "alwaysSerialize".

1999-07-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropertyWriter
	Added facility for defining properties which take arguments,
	supplied by LDM plugin handlers.

1999-07-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* NewSchedule
	Add some mutators for schedules.  COF returns
	NewSchedule. ScheduleImpl implements full api.

1999-07-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropertyWriter
	New facilities:  Generic Collection types, e.g. Collection<Role>
	now fully supported.  Slots may be left unspecified or the def may 
	specify a class to "new" for initial value. Add property controls
	to allow specification of getters/setters - eliminates need for
	some adapters. 

1999-07-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Roles
	Initial work on getting Collections of Roles into the Asset tree.
	OrganizationCapability and AssignedCapability gets a Collections
	of Roles instead of a CSV string.  Complete backward compatability
	maintained with an adapter class offering the old, now deprecated
	methods. 

1999-07-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Workflow.isPropagatingToSubtasks
	Replaces isPropagatingRescind.  Name changed to reflect two
	changes: (1) default value has changed to false, (2) that in
	addition to rescind, add is also propagated when set.

	* alp.cluster.ActiveSubscriptionObject
	implemented by various ldm object so that some
	subscription-related code can be executed at add/remove/change-
	time.  The methods can return false to veto the events.  This
	moves the object vs Subscription interaction code from LPs into
	the affected objects.  WorkflowImpl, PlanElementImpl and TaskImpl
	all implement ASO.
	
1999-07-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* mdla.cluster.LogPlan
	Cleaned up redundant events generated by logic providers.
	
1999-07-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	New method setProperty(Property) does The Right Thing with any
	valid propertyset object.  Uses introspection to figure out the
	setter to use, or uses addOtherProperty as fallback for "foreign"
	properties.  Support changes in all PropertyGroups via
	PropertyWriter. 
	
1999-07-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MB5.2
