	* SimpleAgent, NodeAgent, topology
        Remove topology support, which has been replaced by the
        WhitePages.

2003-02-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/service/PersistenceMetricsService.java:
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	New file defines the PersistenceMetricsService.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/StandardBlackboard.java:
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Call Persistence.registerServices when registering other services
	with the ServiceBroker and Persistence.unregisterServices whch
	unregistering other services. Persistence now supplies
	PersistenceMetricsService and PersistenceControlService to the
	agent but is not itself a component. Perhaps it should be, but it
	isn't. It's part of the distributor and that is part of the
	blackboard.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/ReservationManager.java: 
	Bug #2560 -- Distributor fails to release its persistence reservation
	Added Logger to waitFor method so we can tell what agent is being
	waited for when debugging. Also added toString method so the item
	being waited for prints something reasonable.
	
	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Bug #2560 -- Distributor fails to release its persistence reservation
	Call release reservation after completing persistence at the tail
	end of finishTransaction. This case was missed and doesn't show up
	under stress. It only shows up in a lightly loaded situation.

2003-02-04  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/service/DataProtectionService.java:
	Fix comment said BlackboardProtectionService instead of
	DataProtectionService.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConditionServiceProvider.java:
	Use Collections.unmodifiableSet instead of ReadOnlySet

2003-01-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Bug #2370 -- Persist blocks multiple agents on a per-JVM lock
	Added ReservationManager. When a Distributor decides its time to
	persist, it first makes a reservation to use the persistence
	facility. If the reservation is not granted, persistence is
	deferred and retried at the next opportunity. When the reservation
	is granted, the distributor waits for open transactions to be
	closed out and persistence proceeds. If the reservation is lost
	(times out) before all open transactions can be closed, the
	process is reversed, a new reservation request is made and
	transactions are again allowed. This may repeat until a lack of
	activity permits the transactions to be closed.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/ReservationManager.java:
	New class manages reservations for using the persistence facility.
	This is actually general purpose. A reservation request for a
	particular object can be placed in a queue and its reaching the
	head of the queue sensed. Reservations that are not used in a
	timely fashion are removed from the queue.
	Used for accessing the persistence mechanism so that multiple
	agents do not stack up trying to get the VM global persistence
	lock.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java: 
	Bug # 2249: Pull out 2 constants into -D arguments.
	org.cougaar.core.blackboard.waitForNewCommChangeNotifications
	(default is 1000 ms, as before) is the time to wait for more community
	changes before getting the new ABA translations. This is the
	number Ray suggested tweaking.

	While I was there...
	org.cougaar.core.blackboard.waitForSomeCommChanges
	(default is 10000ms, as before) is the time to wait if have no comm
	changes before killing this thread.

	available.

2002-09-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlaybookManager.java:
	Bug #2207 -- PlaybookManager throws NoSuchElementException when an
	a playbook isn't specified.
	Check for missing playbook file name and log an error instead of
	the exception.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OperatingModeServiceProvider.java:
	Bug #2235 -- Concurrent modification when iterating all OperatingMode
	names.
	getAllOperatingModeNames tried to return a safe Set of operating
	mode names, but used ReadOnlySet which is only a wrapper for the
	original set. A copy is needed to divorce the result given to the
	client from the keySet of the operating mode map which will
	continue to change as operating modes are added.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AdaptivityEngine.java:
	Bug #2221 -- Adaptivity Engine should not log errors for missing
	operating modes
	Missing OperatingModes produce no complaint.
	Missing Conditions are printed only after running for awhile (one
	minute). The delay can be altered providing the plugin with a
	single long parameter giving milliseconds to delay.

2002-08-29  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/CompletionServlet.java: 
	Bug #2159 -- Extend completion servlet to report on all agents
	simultaneously.
	Add viewType url parameter with various values including:
	viewAllAgents to present a page containing all agents.
	viewAgentSmall to present a tiny page summarizing one agent.
	viewTitle to present a page containing an arbitrary title to be
	placed inside a frame when presenting all agents using frames
	(necessary for Netscape 4 and less).
	viewMoreLink tp present a page containing a link for continuation
	of a page of more agents.
	Shows a bunch of IFRAMES for Mozilla/5, MSIE 5, MSIE 6 browsers.
	Uses frames for all others. Mozilla, netscape 6, and IE 5 and 6
	work better than others.

	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/CompletionServlet.java: 
	Bug #2160 -- Completion servlet table view should show task verb
	Add a table column for the task verb.
	
	* org/cougaar/planning/servlet/data/completion/AbstractTask.java:
	Bug #2160 -- Completion servlet table view should show task verb
	Add slot and accessors for a verb.

	Bug #2154 -- NSCallbackImpls are using the default socket factory
	Get and use org.cougaar.core.mts.SocketFactory instance to enable SSL.

	* org/cougaar/core/mts/SocketFactory.java: Bug #2157 --

	* org/cougaar/core/topology/TopologyReaderServiceComponent.java:
	Bug #2106 -- long delay propagating incarnation number
	Add additional debug logging to try to pinpoint what is happening.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java:
	Bug #2088 -- Rehydration may erroneously resurrect deleted remote tasks
	Check for null and avoid NPE. Null means there is no current
	translation for the ABA in the cache. This is somewhat anomalous
	because it means a relay was not sent using this ABA yet there is
	a relay on the blackboard using that ABA. I hope this means that
	the Relay was about to be sent, but the LP hadn't not yet been
	invoked. The fix will cause the RelayLP to do nothing. If my hope
	is fulfilled, the Relay will be sent when the LP is invoked
	normally.

2002-08-02  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
        Bug #1847, "After persistence, no servlet response"
        Altered distributor locking to prevent deadlock between message
        delivery and persistence.  Cleaned up the code to make the locking
        and transaction-counting strategy clearer.  Added lots of
        assertions.  Ported distributor file-log to use the logger.

2002-07-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Bug #1832 -- Empty blackboard after rehydrate
	The "everything" subscription of the Blackboard was no longer
	being filled aftr rehydration. The fix to suppress erroneous error
	reports of failure to find saved subscriber state went too far and
	bypassed the code to fill _all_ subscriptions of the blackboard
	from the rehydrationEnvelope.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java:
	Bug #1826 -- MessageAttributes not always propagated to DirectiveMessage
	MessageAddress.equals does not compare qosAttributes as expected.
	Added a wrapper class for destinations that _does_ compare
	qosAttributes and use the wrapper as the key to the destination
	map when addresses have qosAttributes. The bare message address is
	still used as the key when there are no qosAttributes.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Various persistence bugs
	Check for fillSubscription after the first transaction. Log
	info-level message stating that such late subscriptions will not
	be "rehydrate" only filled.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayLP.java:
	Bug #1825 - Failure to check for null change report collection
	Check for null change report changeTarget and create a singleton
	collection of the MarkerReport if there are no changes. Else, copy
	the collection to a new arraylist and add the MarkerReport.

	Still problems in calling distribute while persisting. They are
	now fixed?

2002-07-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Bug #1771 -- NODE died shortly after concurrent modification error
	and possibly
	Bug #1727 -- Base Persistence errors
	A crack in the distributor allowed persistence snapshots to be
	initiated with a bunch of envelopes still undistributed. Depending
	on the timing, these envelopes could be distributed in time to
	make it into the persistence snapshot (and not be otherwise
	noticed), or they could be added to the epoch envelopes just as
	that List was being copied (yielding concurrent modifications
	exceptions) or could appear to be planelements that had not been
	published (omitting PlanElement not on blackboard errors).
	The code has been restructured to eliminate the crack.

2002-06-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Distributor, Subscriber, InitializeSubscriptionEnvelope, Subscription
	Fix ancient bug where initial fill of a subscription could be
	transactionally out of sync with the subscriber. Fixes bug 1381.
	Also updated a bunch of printlns to use Logging.

2002-06-06  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

	* AgentBinder, AgentManager, agent subclasses
        Fixed bug 1423, "Agent binder denies binder wrappers .."
        Made AgentBinder an interface, and moved implementation 
        into new DefaultAgentBinder class.  Renamed 
        AgentBinderFactory to DefaultAgentBinderFactory, and 
        fixed clients of this factory to use the new name.  
        Modified AgentBinder clients to use the new 
        "getAgentIdentifier()" method instead of "getAgent()"
        where possible.

	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveAssetVerificationLP
	* org/cougaar/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP	
	Update transferring assets availability schedule to reflect the
	start/end and 'owning' asset. Bug 877
	
2002-06-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/plugin/DefaultPluginBinder
	extend ContainedBinderSupport rather than BinderSupport so that
	plugins have access to ContainedService.

	* org/cougaar/core/domain/RootFactory.java
	Add some null argument assertions.  bug 1410
	
	* org/cougaar/core/agent/service/registry/PrototypeRegistry.java
	Add some null argument assertions and some synchronizes. bug 1410

	* org/cougaar/core/node/NodeAgent.java
	move LoggingService to HIGH pass (bug 1398).  Addded javadoc on
	which components and services get loaded at which priorities.

	* org/cougaar/core/logging/LoggingServiceProvider.java
	Moved much of this to
	util:org.cougaar.util.log.log4j.Log4jFactoryImpl

	* org/cougaar/core/logging/NullLoggingServiceImpl.java
	refactored

	* org/cougaar/core/node/NodeAgent.java
	Simplify startup of LoggingService

	* org/cougaar/core/service/LoggingService.java
	Simplify slightly.

2002-05-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Subscriber.java, org/cougaar/core/blackboard/BlackboardServiceProvider.java
	Subscriber no longer implements BlackboardService.  Instead, the
	BlackboardServiceProvider returns a private class extending
	Subscriber which actually does.  This fixes bug 1136.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Subscriber.java
	Check for open transactions earlier in call chain, e.g. in
	publish* rather than in client*Object. bug 826.

	* org/cougaar/core/node/INIParser.java, org/cougaar/core/node/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java
	If no component arguments, leave ComponentDescription parameter
	null - bug 1372.

2002-05-28  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayLP.java:
	Check getSource() for null before proceeding with Relay.Target
	processing. This handles the case of an all-in-one-class Relay
	implementation being erroneously handled as a Target at the Source
	end. The opposite case of mishandling as a Source at the Target
	end is already dealt with.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/Relay.java:
	Augment javadoce with cautions about aliasing possibilities when
	sending Relays between agents in the same node.

2002-05-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/service/SchedulerService.java:
	Add a little bit of javadoc for parameters.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayLP.java:
	Fix bug handling null change report collection. Ya gotta create a
	new collection before you can add to it.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Silence "persistence overdue" message -- it's misleading and
	unnecessary -- persistence is always overdue before it's
	performed. That's why it happens.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/TaskSensorPlugin.java:
	Fix problem with measuring the dispose rate. The removed list of
	an incremental subscription having a DynamicUnaryPredicate is not
	populated with objects just because the predicate becomes false
	unless a publishChange is done on the object. That is not normally
	done when a Task is disposed (allocated, expanded, etc.) so we
	would not see any disposes unless the Task were actually
	rescinding. Instead, we need to separately subscribe to the plan
	elements to count disposes.

2002-05-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SimpleAgent
	Change the load order so that all direct subcomponents are loaded
	before the PluginManager is started.  This fixes bug 1344.

	* NewTask, TaskImpl
	Added addPrepositionalPhrase(PP), setPrepositionalPhrases(PP), and
	deprecated setPrepositionalPhrases(PP) as confusing.

2002-05-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* NodeAgent
	Support for bug 1340, with some additional cleanups.

	* SimpleAgent
	Accept direct externally-specified components - bug 1340.

	* Agent
	Minor cleanup of dead code.

2002-05-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardQueryService, etc
	Simpler blackboard access for clients which need only point
	queries. Closes bug 1140.

2002-05-16  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* mts, topology, SimpleAgent, NodeAgent:
        Fixed bug 1313, "Separate topology from MTS"
        Moved topology related code from MTS to separate service 
        providers.  Created new topology reader/writer services.
        Modified agent and node-agent to use the new topology APIs.
        Created new "/topology" servlet.

2002-05-09  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/CPUTestPlugin.java:
	More elaborate schedule of cpu condition for testing.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java:
	Ignore org.cougaar.core.persistence.enabled. Always create
	persistence so that agent mobility is always possible. See
	BasePersistence checkin message for more detail.

	* org/cougaar/core/service/BlackboardService.java: 
	Bug 1232
	Define closeTransactionDontReset.
	Deprecate closeTransaction(boolean);

	* org/cougaar/core/servlet/SimpleServletSupportImpl.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/mobility/servlet/MoveAgentServlet.java: 
	Bug 1232
	Use closeTransactionDontReset.
	
	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Subscriber.java:
	Bug 1232
	Define closeTransactionDontReset.
	Deprecate closeTransaction(boolean);

2002-05-08  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Subscriber.java:
	Avoid stuffing the inbox with envelopes if there are no
	subscriptions. The inbox is not emptied until the next transaction
	is opened and subscribers (such as servlets) may never open a
	transaction causing unbounded build-up of envelopes until memory
	is exhausted. New logic skips inbox stuffing if the number of
	subscriptions is zero and there is no open transaction. In
	addition, when an open transaction is closed and there are not
	(remaining) subscriptions, the inbox is cleared.

2002-05-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/SearchStringParser.java:
	Bug 1274
	Change equality comparison for multi-valued attributes to be true
	if any of the attribute values is equal.

2002-05-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/node/NodeAgent.java:
	Fixes the bug about UnsupportedOperationException when the
	NodeAgent receives a Relay.
	Call super.receiveMessage() with any message not otherwise
	handled.

2002-04-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/node/NodeAgent.java:
	Bug 1244
	Print more about the offending message so the problem can be debugged.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/TaskSensorPlugin.java:
	Bug 1243
	Correctly compute publish and dispose rates instead of total
	publish and dispose events. Also adjust for discrete sampling of
	more or less continous random process in low pass filter.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OMCBase.java:
	Bug 1243
	Print the bad value when setValue complains about bad values.

2002-05-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Debug
	references to org.cougaar.util.Debug removed as dead code.

2002-05-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Version
	Release 9.2.0
	
2002-04-25  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java:
	Bug 1212
	Accomodate method name changes to fix bug 1212. This code itself
	still needs work to correctly implement attribute-based address
	resolution

	* org/cougaar/multicast/AttributeBasedAddress.java: 
	Bug 1212
	Change "role" to "attribute". These are attribute-based addressed,
	not role-based addresses.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java:
	Improve documentation of updateOperatingModes to include the case
	of attribute-based remote operating modes. Also fix the parser of
	such mode names. Difficult to test because there is no way to use
	attribute-based addressing yet.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AdaptivityEngine.java:
	Fix documentation of updateOperatingModes -- the real work is now
	done in PlayHelper.

2002-04-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java:
	Finish inter-agent operating mode policy implementation for
	attribute-based addresses.

2002-04-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/TaskSensorPlugin.java:
	This plugin implements the new task rate/backlog sensor
	conditions. Publishes three conditions for rate of creating new
	tasks, rate of disposal of tasks, and current task backlog. Filter
	time constant is 30 seconds. Update interval is 10 seconds. Read
	the javadoc for more detail.
	
2002-04-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Parser.java:
	Improve javadoc.

2002-04-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingServiceFactory.java:
	Addresses Bug 1095
	Try forever when errors occur trying to get initial context from
	the NS. Pause between attempts.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java:
	Improve error logging when missing Conditions exist. Only log one
	error line unless debug is on, the give a stack trace too.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/InterAgentCondition.java:
	Return bit flags from updateResponse

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayLP.java:
	Use "instanceof" for distinguishing source and target objects. The
	allows implementations where the same object serves as both a
	target and a source. By giving the source a set of targets, we get
	automatic forwarding through multiple levels of agents.
	Avoid reverberation by the LP responding to its own changes by
	marking such changes with a special ChangeReport marker. Such
	changes are completely ignored by the LP. Instead, responses that
	are required and handle directly at the point of the change.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/Relay.java:
	Move getSource method out of the Relay base interface. It is only
	needed in the Relay.Target interface.
	Define bit flags constants for marking return values from
	updateContent and updateResponse methods.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PolicyManager.java:
	Declare this interface public. Extensions of public interfaces
	must be public.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Playbook.java:
	Put the plays resulting from OperatingModePolicy first in the
	constrained plays list. This insures that they will dominate any
	other plays and also insures that any OperatingModeConditions they
	set will be valid when used in ordinary plays.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java:
	Look for missing Conditions as values of operating modes set by
	earlier plays.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/MetricsTestPlugin.java:
	Test plugin that is a sensor translating some values from the
	metrics service into Conditions.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/InterAgentOperatingModePolicy.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/InterAgentOperatingMode.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/InterAgentCondition.java:
	Accomodate change in return value from
	updateContent/updateResponse. These are now ints having two flags
	instead of booleans.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Condition.java:
	Fix @link constructs in javadoc. They are not allowed to be split
	across line boundaries.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AdaptivityEngine.java:
	Remove missing condition checks. Instead, plays referencing
	missing conditions are identified as they are encountered. This is
	necessitated by the possibility of Conditions that are set by
	plays.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Parser.java:
	Improve error reporting. Parse error messages now say more
	precisely what is wrong, show the line number on which the error
	occurred and show the offending token. Also, attempts to resync
	and continue parsing plays after an error.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PolicyTestPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PolicyRemoteTestPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PolicyInjectorPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlaybookManager.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AEViewerServlet.java:
	Pass LoggingService and the reader to parser instead of a
	StreamTokenizer.

2002-04-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* StandardSecurityComponent, NodeTrustComponent
	Children of NodeAgent - that is, most components which were
	previously children of Node - are now bound by
	AgentChildBindingSite rather than AgentManagerBindingSite.

2002-04-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/agent/SimpleAgent, org/cougaar/core/agent/ClusterImpl
	Most of ClusterImpl moved to SimpleAgent.
	
	* org/cougaar/core/node/NodeAgent
	Most Node functionality moved to NodeAgent from Node
	
	* Various
	Began move from ClusterIdentifier to MessageAddress.
	PluginBindingSite and lower still use ClusterIdentifier.

2002-04-11  Noelle Givler  <ngivler@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/domain:
	Domain now implemented in a component hierarchy. DomainAdapter class 
	can be extended to create new Domains.

	* org/cougaar/core/domain/RootDomain:
	* org/cougaar/multicast/ABMDomain:
	Reimplemented as an extension of DomainAdapter.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard:
        * org/cougaar/core/agent/ClusterImpl:
	Modified to use new DomainService and DomainForBlackboardService.

	* org/cougaar/planning/plugin/AssetDataPluginBase:
	* org/cougaar/core/agent/service/registry/DefaultPrototypeProviderPlugin:
	Compatibility changes for DomainService
	
2002-04-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Distributor.java:
	Changes to support persistence adaptivity.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Parser.java:
	Make [] be word characters to allow names of the form:
	[agent.3ID].Plugin.control

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OperatingModePolicy.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/InterAgentOperatingModePolicy.java:
	Add constructor taking PolicyKernel.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ThreatconTestPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/TaskRateSensorPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PolicyTestPlugin.java:

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/CPURemoteTestPlugin.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AdaptivityEngine.java:
	Separate playbook management functions into a separate component.
	Beginning of implementation of interface to
	InterAgentOperatingModePolicy.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OMCRangeList.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OMCRange.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConstrainingClause.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayBase.java: 
	Add equals methods to various classes to facilitate change
	detection.

2002-04-05  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/AnonymousChangeReport.java:
	New class which represents an unspecified change report, due
	to a "publishChange(o)" or "publishChange(o, null)" or
	"publishChange(o, empty-collection)".  Contains singleton
	instance and SET/LIST singletons.

	* Subscriber, Blackboard:
        * CollectionSubscription, IncrementalSubscription:
	Modified to use the AnonymousChangeReport singletons.
	IncrementalSubscription now uses a Set for its changes,
        instead of a List -- it shares the CollectionSubscription's
        "changeMap".  This might require performance tuning.

2002-04-02  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Playbook.java:
	Use named inner class instead of anonymous.

2002-03-28  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayLP.java:
	Logic providers to implement Relay transfers.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/RelayDirective.java:
	Directives for messages about Relay objects.

	* org/cougaar/core/relay/Relay.java:
	Interface definitions for Relay objects.

2002-03-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ThreatconTestPlugin.java:
	Change SensorMeasurement to SensorMeasurementImpl

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/TaskRateSensorPlugin.java:
	Plugin measures the rate of arrival/change/departure of tasks
	providing a SensorMeasurement for the AdaptivityEngine.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/SensorMeasurementImpl.java:
	The normal implementation of SensorMeasurement.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/SensorMeasurement.java:
	This is now an interface so that multple implementations are
	possible. Allows the OperatingModeSensorMeasurement class to be
	both an OperatingMode and a SensorMeasurement.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Playbook.java:
	Change test code to work with new ConstrainingPhrase.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/PlayHelper.java:
	The play interpreter engine from AdaptivityEngine so it can be
	used by the PolicyManager as well.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Parser.java:
	Add arithmetic grammar so that SensorMeasurements can be combined
	arithmetically.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OperatingModeSensorMeasurement.java:
	New class implements both SensorMeasurement and OperatingMode
	interfaces. Intended for use with two-phase policy iterpretation.
	Acts as an OperatingMode to be set by policy and a
	SensorMeasurement to be interpreted by the AdaptivityEngine. The
	value feeds through.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OperatingModeImpl.java:
	Implementation of OperatingMode (which see).

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/OperatingMode.java: This is now an
	interface so that multiple implementations are possible. However,
	only the OperatingModeImpl should be necessary.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConstraintPhrase.java:
	Now extends ConstraintOpValue and contains only the
	SensorMeasurement part.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConstraintOpValue.java:
	New class captures the operator and value part of a
	ConstraintPhrase to use in if clause where there is not
	necessarily a single SensorMeasurement, but rather, a computed
	value.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConstrainingClause.java:
	Allow more kinds of objects to be pushed into the clause including
	String and Number.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ComparableHelper.java:
	Add support for doing arithmetic with Comparable objects.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/CPUTestPlugin.java:
	Remove variation to simplify demo.

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/Operator.java:
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ConstraintOperator.java:
	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/BooleanOperator.java:
	Add precedence and operand count

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/ArithmeticOperator.java:
	New class defines arithmetic operators

	* org/cougaar/core/adaptivity/AdaptivityEngine.java:
	Add arbitrary arithmetic expressions for if clauses
	Move the play interpretation engine to a separate helper class

2002-03-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/service/SensorMeasurementService.java:
	New Service for accessing SensorMeasurements

	* org/cougaar/core/service/PlaybookReadService.java:
	New Service for Reading the Playbook

	* org/cougaar/core/service/PlaybookConstrainService.java:
	New Service for constraining the Playbook

	* org/cougaar/core/service/OperatingModeService.java:
	New Service for accessing OperatingModes.

	* org/cougaar/util/ReadOnlyCollection.java:
	* org/cougaar/util/ReadOnlySet.java:
	New classes wrapping Collections and Sets respectively that
	prohibit modification of the wrapped Collection or Set. These
	should be used by any method (particularly Service methods) that
	wish to return a read-only copy of some internal Collection or
	Set. This should be much more efficient in most cases while
	protecting the integrity of the underlying Collection or Set.

	* org/cougaar/util/KeyedSet.java:
	Add functionality to optionally make the underlying Map be a
	synchronized Map. This is necessary whenever the KeyedSet can be
	referenced from a Thread other than the one updating the
	subscription. Also added an accessor for the keySet() of the
	underlying Map. This is more efficient than building the Set of
	keys from the Set of elements. The new methods are:
	makeSynchronized() which replaces the underlying Map with a
	SynchronizedMap wrapper around that underlying Map. This can be
	done at any time, but should only be done once and should be done
	before it is used. The following code is typical:
	   MyKeyedSet mks = new MyKeyedSet();
	   mks.makeSynchronized();
	   subscription = subscribe(mks);
	keySet() returns a Set of the keys of the underlying Map.

2002-03-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/log/log4j/Log4jLoggerFactory.java:
	Use Class.getName() instead of Class.toString() in constructing
	the name of the category of a logger. JDK1.4 has gratuitously
	changed the value returned from Class.toString() to include the
	word "class " before the name of the class. The getName() method
	is more correct in any case.

2002-03-11  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/Blackboard.java: 
	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/StandardBlackboard.java:
	Pass ServiceBroker to BasePersistence so it can use the logging
	service.

2002-03-94  Noelle Givler  <ngivler@bbn.com>

	* PropertyGroupSchedule:
	add()/remove() methods act upon the default if appropriate. add() 
	calls setDefault() if the TimePhasedPropertyGroup to be added runs 
	from TimeSpan.MIN_VALUE to TimeSpan.MAX_VALUE. remove() calls 
	clearDefault() if the TimePhasedPropertyGroup to be removed is the 
	same as the default (using .equals() for comparison).

2002-02-27  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter:
	Fixed "load()" race-condition bug, where blackboard watcher
	could be triggered before the trigger-handler was set.


2002-01-29  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataDBReader.java:
	Parse relationship start and end times independently. Use default
	for null and in case of parse failure.

2001-12-13  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* Trigger, Plugin-base-classes, SchedulerService:
        Fixed bug 938, "Need thread-safe "TriggerModel" for Component 
        "suspend()"".  Created new "TriggerModel" API and thread-safe 
        implementation, "SyncTriggerModelImpl".  Modified Plugin 
        base-classes to use the new TriggerModel API for clean
        "start/suspend/resume/stop" state transitions.

2001-11-29  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/*Message.java:
        Created a new "AgentManagementMessage" base class for use by
        "MoveAgentMessage" and "CloneAgentMessage".

	* Node, AgentManager, ClusterImpl:
        Modified Node to accept the clone message and delegate to the
        AgentManager.  Modified AgentManager to add the new 
        "cloneAgent(..)" message, plus minor refactoring for shared 
        "moveAgent(..)" support.  Modified ClusterImpl to add a 
        "getState()" that excludes the Blackboard, since a Agent clone 
        can optionally exclude the Blackboard.


2001-11-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/lps/ReceiveAssetVerificationLP.java:
	Fix getUnmatched method to compare relationships both ways:
	assuming that roleA of one relationship corresponds to roleA of
	the other and again with roleA corresponding to roleB.
	Relationships can be expressed from both points of view and are
	equivalent.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/StandardBlackboard.java:
	Implement restartAgent method by invoking restartAgent on the
	Distributor.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/BlackboardForAgent.java:
	Add restartAgent method to inform the blackboard that some agent
	has restarted. This kicks off the agent state reconcilation
	procedure relative to the restarted agent.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NSLS.java:
	Add class name of object to output.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java:
	Control query logging through a system property.
	Add class javadoc documenting the property.

2001-11-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SharedThreading*, SharedPluginManager
	Dropped.  Fully replaced by SchedulerService - see below.

2001-11-15  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java:
	Add addQueryFile method so additional query files can be added.

2001-11-14  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java:
	Insure that the driver class is loaded for all queries not just
	those using the main connection.

2001-11-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SecurityComponent, StandardSecurityComponent, Node
	Abstraction of Security Management tool from NAI&Boeing, in
	Component form.  Privileged Node-level component, loaded before
	any external components are considered. StandardSecurityComponent
	implements NAI/Boeing code as before, but requires
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.security.Component=org.cougaar.core.security.StandardSecurityComponent
	in order to activate it.  Better would be to move it to the
	security jar.  Node updated to load the SecurityComponent if
	requested.

2001-11-13  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>

	* TrafficMaskingGeneratorAspect, TrafficMaskingStatistics
	Implement the TrafficMaskingGeneratorService API.  Also generate
	TrafficMaskingStatistics for each node. Cleanup Aspect to try to
	share a Timer instance for multiple TimerTasks. Ensure that the
	reply timertask is started whether we start from system params or
	turn on request from the controller.

	* TrafficMaskingGeneratorServiceProvider
	New provider to provide TrafficMaskingGeneratorService.  This
	service is hooked into the MT ServiceBroker so that other MT
	Aspects (children) can access it.

	* StandardAspect
	Provide getBindingSite() for Aspects since StandardAspect has a
	final setBindingSite().
	
2001-11-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java:
	Throw exception if translateAttributeValue finds no translate
	(query returns no row).

2001-11-12  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>

	* TrafficMaskingAspect, TrafficMaskingGeneratorAspect
	Rename TrafficMaskingAspect to TrafficMaskingGeneratorAspect to
	avoid conflicts with quo masking aspect that controls traffic
	masking. Add ability to turn on and parameterize the generator
	aspect with system properties. property for requestPeriod in ms is defined
	-Dorg.cougaar.message.trafficGenerator.requestPeriod=<int of ms>
	and optionally reply think time
	-Dorg.cougaar.message.trafficGenerator.replyThinkTime=<int of ms>

	* TrafficMaskingGeneratorService
	New API for the Traffic Masking Controller to turn on and off (and
	set parameters) in the Traffic Masking Generator

	* TrafficMaskingStatistics
	New object to hold traffic maskig statistics per node.

	* MessageTransportServiceProvider
	Always add the TrafficMaskingGeneratorAspect.  It will not
	generate traffic unless system params are set or the masking
	controller turns it on.

2001-11-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/ConfigFinder
	Add find(URL) method to return the URL used by open.  Useful for
	debugging purposes, but expensive.

2001-11-09  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>

	* TrafficMaskingAspect
	New MT aspect that generates fake message traffic to include fake
	requests and replies of varying sizes.  Request messages are sent
	to random nodes.  Used in MT Adaptivity work.

2001-11-08  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java:
	Remove obsolete code containing references to obsolete
	RMINameServer.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NSLS.java:
	Use new NamingServiceFactory instead of RMINameServer.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/Communications.java:
	Remove obsolete reference to RMINameServer.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingServiceProvider.java:
	Use the new NamingServiceFactory instead of RMINameServer.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingServiceFactory.java:
	This is a new implementation of the old RMINameServer. This is a
	much cleaner, more straightforward and efficient implementation.

2001-11-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter
	Port to use SchedulerServiceProvider.

	* ComponentPlugin
	Effective use of new per-node scheduler, avoiding occasional
	multi-thread execution of the same scheduled instance.

	* SchedulerServiceProvider
	Rewrite and merge with PluginScheduler.  By default, now uses a
	per-node scheduler of a pool of threads rather than single
	per-agent thread for performance improvement and additional
	parallelism. 

	* ClusterImpl
	Use only new SchedulerServiceProvider instead of PluginScheduler.

	* org.cougaar.core.node.Bootstrapper
	Changed rules for the bootstrap classloader to avoid the whole
	package-prefix exclusion-list mess.  Essentially, the classloader
	will attempt to load classes from "discovered" jars and then defer
	to the system classloader to try to find everything else.

2001-11-02  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java (Repository): Remove dbspec
	arg when reading a query file. The default dbspec is obtained from
	the query file itself. Add methods for interpreting queries
	relative to an arbitrary database.

2001-11-01  Beth DePass	   <bdepass@bbn.com>

	* NodeTrustComponent
	New Node level component that recieves Node level policy messages
	and provides a service to other Node level components to share the
	current policy status.  Used in MT Adaptivity work.

	* TrustStatusService, TrustStatusServiceImpl,
	TrustStatusServiceProvider
	New Service to disseminate Node level policy information.  Backed
	by NodeTrustComponent.  Used in MT Adaptivity work.

	* NodeTrustPolicy, PolicyMulticastMessage
	New policy and message type to contain Node level security
	policies.  Used in MT Adaptivity work.

	* PanicButtonPlugin
	Plugin that provides a GUI to define Node level security
	Policies.  Plugin sends NodeTrustPolicies to Nodes. Used in MT
	Adaptivity work.

2001-10-31  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/component/ComponentFactory.java (Repository):
	Merge from V8_6_0
	Remove the test for the parameter of a component being a
	Collection. It makes no difference what its type is; always, just
	store the parameter, whatever it is. 

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Merge from V8_6_0
	Remove superfluous query definitions.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataDBReader.java (Repository):
	Merge from V8_6_0
	Use default start and end times for time-phased relationships if
	either start or end is bogus (e.g. null).

2001-10-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Add query time logging. The time for every query is written to a
	file. Disabled by default. Log file creation must be uncommented
	to use.

2001-10-19  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/Node.java, ExternalNodeControl*
	Removed the AppServer's "external-controller" registration 
        with the Node.  A future refactoring will replace the 
        removed code with a cleaner design.
        This removes the dependency of server upon core, and in the 
        future core will depend upon server.

2001-10-18  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java (Repository):
	Add create from URL method so that resources can be used in
	addition to config path files.

2001-10-11  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@HEFEWEIZEN>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java (Repository):
	Detect missing queries. Never return a null from getQuery. Throw
	IllegalArgumentException instead. Identify the query file with the
	missing query.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Undo earlier fix. Null parent name just can't work. Throw an
	exception if specified.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java (Repository):
	Fix bug #608.
	Check SearchControls.getReturningObjFlag and return the bound
	value in the SearchResults when true.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Allow for possible null parent name in queries. (Requires a new
	DBInitializer.q file)

2001-10-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@HEFEWEIZEN>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Minor debugging changes.

2001-10-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@HEFEWEIZEN>

	* org/cougaar/core/society/Node.java (Repository):
	Accomodate changes to more generic initializer services. Need to
	provide parent information that was implicit in earlier API.
	
	* org/cougaar/core/society/InitializerService.java (Repository):
	* org/cougaar/core/society/FileInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository): 
	Revised to treat plugins and agents and other components more
	uniformly.
	
	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Revised queries treat plugins and agent and other components more
	uniformly.

2001-09-28  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* *.java
	Added lots of @property tags for our new doclet.  See the
	documentation for org.cougaar.tools.javadoc for more information.

2001-09-27  Todd Wright  <twright@bbn.com>

        * org/cougaar/core/society/Node.java:
	Enhanced "-D" property and command-line parsing.  All
	command-line arguments now have "-D" equivalents.  Fixed
	post-classname "-D" arguments to now behave like pre-classname
	"-D" System Properties.

2001-09-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java (Repository):
	Allow for multiple occurances of the same variable.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/InitializerService.java (Repository):
	Add new methods to API

	* org/cougaar/core/society/FileInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Add new API. The translateAttributeValue method just echoes its
	arguments since translation is not needed for file-based
	initialization. The getAssetDataReader returns an
	AssetDataFileReader instance.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Switch toe "V3" style database: multiple assembly ids, etc. Add
	new api for returning asset reader. Add translateAttributeValue
	method to do query-based substitution of attribute values.	

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataReader.java (Repository):
	The API of an asset data reader.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataPluginBase.java (Repository):
	Extensively revised to separate out the reader functions into a
	separate class rather than a subclass. This allows the same plugin
	to be used for both file-based and database-based asset reading.
	The InitializerService provides the correct implementation of the
	AssetDataReader according to whether initialization is begin done
	from a database or files.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataFileReader.java (Repository):
	Implementation of AssetDataReader using files (prototype-ini.dat).

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataDBReader.java (Repository):
	Implementation of AssetDataReader using a database.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataCallback.java (Repository):
	This new interface defines the API of readers to be used by the
	AssetDataPlugin. It allows the reading of asset definitions (e.g.
	Organizations) from various media.

2001-09-25  Jim Winston  <jwinston@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/plan/AllocationResult
	Added   AspectValue[] difference(Preference[] prefs) method
	This method is for use by expander plugins to see which
	if any AspectValues in failed allocations have been
	changed or added by the allocator plugin.

2001-09-18  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/plugin/PluginManager.java (Repository):
	Uses the InitializerService to read either a cluster .ini file or
	the config database instead of reading the .ini file itself.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/Node.java (Repository): 
	Check for -X option and create install either a
	DBInitializerServiceProvider or FileInitializerServiceProvider to
	provide InitializerService. If -X is specified, the former is
	created using the experiment id specified with the option. If -X
	is specified, the FileInitializerServiceProvider supplies a
	InitializerService equivalent to the old way of doing things.
	Using the InitializerService to create a ComponentDescription
	array of the agents (and node-level components) to be added to the
	node.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/ArgTableIfc.java (Repository): 
	* org/cougaar/core/society/ArgTable.java (Repository): 
	Add -X command line option for specifying experiment Id.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/InitializerServiceException.java (Repository): 
	Exception to be thrown when failures occur in an
	InitializerService. Mostly wraps the IOException or SQLException
	that occurs when reading a file or database.

	* org/cougaar/core/society/InitializerService.java (Repository): 
	The API for the InitializerService.	

	* org/cougaar/core/society/FileInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository): 
	A service provider implementatation that create
	InitializerServices using files.	

	* org/cougaar/core/society/DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository): 
	A service provider implementation that creates InitializerServices
	using a database.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataPluginFile.java (Repository): 
	File extension of AssetDataPluginBase that reads the information
	from prototype-ini.dat files. This implements is equivalent to
	AssetDataPlugin.	

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataPluginDB.java (Repository): 
	Database extension of AssetDataPluginBase the reads the
	information from a database.	

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/plugin/AssetDataPluginBase.java (Repository): 
	Factored out the media independent part of AssetDataPlugin.	

	* org/cougaar/util/DBProperties.java (Repository):
	This class extends java.util.Properties and adds functions useful
	for handling the contents of q files. In particular, it performs
	parameter substitutions (from cougaar.rc) and variable
	substitutions for (e.g. ':agent_id".

2001-09-13  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/plan/LatLonPoint.java:
	New core implementation for simple (Latitude, Longitude) 
        Locations.  Also added the corresponding "NewLatLonPoint"
        and "LatLonPointImpl".

2001-09-13  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/properties.def:
	Moved GLM's LocationSchedulePG into core.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/asset/assets.def:
	Added LocationSchedulePG to Entity Assets.

2001-09-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/DBConnectionPool.java:
	Set the state of the autoCommit flag to its initial value when
	reusing a pool connection.

	* org/cougaar/util/DBConnectionPool.java:
	Check the state of the auto-commit flag before calling commit
	during a close() operation. Completes the fix for bug 434.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingSocketFactory.java:
	Print instructions on first failure to create ssl client socket.

2001-09-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/Glob.java:
	Moved tests from here to regression test GlobTest.java

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingSocketFactory.java:
	Print instructions on first failure to create ssl server socket.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NSImpl.java:
	Create using NamingSocketFactory.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/RMINameServer.java:
	Create rmi registry using NamingSocketFactory.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingSocketFactory.java:
	Implements RMIServerSocketFactory and RMIClientSocketFactory by
	creating SSLServerSocket and SSLSocket instances respectively.
	Uses the default SSL socket factories. The default SSL socket
	factories use a trust manager based on the contents of
	<java>/jre/lib/security/cacerts and a key manager based on keys
	and certificates in <user.home>/.keystore. This can be overridden
	by system properties on the command line. For example:
	MYPROPERTIES="$MYPROPERTIES -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=keystore"
	MYPROPERTIES="$MYPROPERTIES -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password"
	MYPROPERTIES="$MYPROPERTIES -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=keystore"
	MYPROPERTIES="$MYPROPERTIES -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password"
	Currently, ssl is not enabled by default. To enable ssl set
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.naming.useSSL=true
	The default will probably be changed in the near future.

2001-09-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl, AgentBinder, AgentBindingSite, AgentManager, AgentManagerForBinder
	Make Agent fully responsible for hoooking itself up correctly,
	rather than AgentManager doing it.  As a side effect, this allows
	the use of combining Binders (e.g. "wrapping" binders) of Agents.

2001-09-05  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NSImpl.java:
	Remove debug printlns.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java:
	Remove debug printlns.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NSLS.java:
	Print attributes of naming service entries, too.

2001-08-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/DeletionPlugin.java:
	Add optional parameters for archivingenabled and debug.
	Expect and handle exceptions when asking for start time or end
	time of tasks. An exception is thrown if the task has no such
	preference.

2001-08-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingContext.java:
	Fix bug in getNameInNamespace for root directory.

2001-08-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java:
	Remove unbind override. Nothing special needs to be done about
	attributes. The go away when the binding goes away.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingContext.java:
	Remove extraneous slashs from names returned by
	getNameInNamespace(). Fix unbind so it unbinds contexts, but only
	if called from destroySubcontext. The guts of unbind are now a
	subroutine called from both unbind and destroySubcontext. A
	boolean argument says whether contexts can be destroyed or not.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/SearchStringParser.java:
	Fix bug caused by treating space as separator. Spaces are ignored
	between what are otherwise tokens, but to not separate tokens nor
	are they tokens themselves.

2001-08-24  Lora Goldston  <lgoldsto@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/util/DBConnectionPool.java
	Added supportsTransactions check before calling commit.  Only
	call commit if the database supports transactions.  Some 
	non-transactional database drivers are throwing exceptions when 
	commit is called with true.

2001-08-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java:
	Finish fixing the toString(StringBuffer) method.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/SearchStringParser.java:
	Remove space from toString output. The canonical form of a filter
	string is sans-whitespace.

2001-08-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/SearchStringParser.java:
	Add documentation. Add toString to all filters that return a
	string that will parse to the same value.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/Glob.java:
	Add documentation. Fix bug in parsing [...] patterns containing -
	and ] characters.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/Filter.java:
	Add toString(StringBuffer) method for composing toString values.

2001-08-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/NamingDirContext.java:
	Redo search in terms of the Filter interface. Implement the search
	forms taking a search string.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/SearchStringParser.java:
	Parses a jndi search string (RFC 2254) into a Filter. Doesn't do
	arbitrary attribute descriptions or matching rules. Does do &, !,
	|, simple, substring, present matches.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/Glob.java:
	This class parses a Unix glob-style pattern matching filter string
	into a form can be readily applied to strings to test for a match.

	* org/cougaar/core/naming/Filter.java:
	The interface to be implemented by all search filters.

	* org/cougaar/util/ArrayListFoundation.java:
	Don't hold the monitor (be synchronized) while serializing
	sub-objects. Doing so is prone to deadlock when multiple threads
	are serializing simultaneously. This requires copying the
	elementData array to prevent its being modified while
	serialization occurs.

2001-08-21  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* ClusterImpl, ClusterServesPlugin, PluginAdapter
	Remove old metrics code such as getMetricsSnapshot,
	getMetrics.  Also remove code related to the MetricsHeartbeat
	which pushed metrics data to a client. All code should now
	utilize the various node and agent level metrics services.
	PluginAdapter has some remaining getMetricsSnapshot() methods
	for backwards compatability that currenlty throw a Runtime
	Exception when called.  

	* MetricsLP, MetricsMessage, RemoteClusterMetrics, MetricsService
	Remove old code used for pushing metrics data to clients.
	Also remove the temporary MetricsService and
	MetricsServiceProvider classes which passed metrics requests 
	through to metrics snapshots.

	* StandardBlackboard
	Add BlackboardMetricsService to the ServiceBroker after the 
	BlackboardService is added. Note they are both created using
	the BlackboardServiceProvider.

	* NodeMetricsService, NodeMetricsServiceProvider, Node
	Create a new node level metrics service that provides
	VM level stats such as free memory, thread counts, etc.
	Create the service implementation and service provider
	in Node and add the service to the Node level ServiceBroker.
	
2001-08-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AgentChildBindingSite, etc
	Replaced PluginManagerBindingSite with AgentChildBindingSite so
	that a single binding site can be used with both pluginmanager and
	blackboard.

	* StandardBlackboard, et.al.
	StandardBlackboard is now a real child component of Agent which
	encapsulates the old Blackboard + Distributor functionality.  Lots
	more cleanup to be done here, but this is a start.  Blackboard
	communicates back to the Agent with a BlackboardForAgent service.
	Persistence (and agent mobility) will be temporarly broken until
	this gets shaken out.

2001-08-16  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

        * Node, AgentManager, Agent, PluginManager, etc
        Initial support for AgentMobility, including support
        for recursive Agent suspend and state-gathering.

2001-08-13  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/DeletionPlugin.java:
	Redo DeletionSchedulePolicy using RuleParameters exclusively.
	Explicit scheduled deletion times are LongRuleParameters that have
	a name with a particular prefix. The rest of the name is the time
	of the deletion in a particular format.

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/policy/Policy.java:
	Add Remove method so RuleParameters can be removed.

	* org/cougaar/core/blackboard/BlackboardService.java:
	Add persistNow() method to force a persistence snapshot to be
	taken. Using this method requires care because it must manipulate
	the transaction state of the plugin. See the caution in the
	javadoc.
	
2001-08-13  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* PrototypeRegistry*, ClusterImpl
	Hook back in Prototype Provider, Property Provider and Cached
	Prototype counts through the PrototypeRegistryService.  These
	counts are used by the metrics service (currently in ClusterImpl).

2001-08-13  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/DeletionPlugin.java:
	Add DeletionSchedulePolicy to control the timing of deletion
	activity. This captures the former capability and extends it to
	control the phasing of the activity -- e.g. weekly deletion occurs
	at a particular time on a particular day of the week. In addition,
	specific, ad hoc, deletions can be scheduled and will be performed
	when due. In the absence of any existing deletion schedule policy,
	a default one is created from the parameters of the plugin. The
	BlackboardService is requested to take a persistence snapshot
	prior to any deletion activity.

2001-08-10  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* ClusterImpl
	Create and add the PluginManager component via a
	ComponentDescription instead of an instance.
		
	* PluginManager, AgentManager
	Move Plugin creation from AgentManager.createCluster to
	PluginManager.load().  PluginManager now reads the ini file to
	create the Agent's plugins.
	
2001-08-09  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* PluginManager
	Remove remaining ClusterImpl dependencies.  PluginManager can now
	be constructed with an empty argument constructor.

	* PluginManager, PluginBinder, PluginAdapter, etc.
	Remove old style LDMservice and UIDServer dependencies up the
	component chain.  PluginAdapter now uses the DomainService,
	PrototypeRegistryService and UIDService.  The LDMService is still
	being used for getLDM() calls, but this service eventually
	delegates to getDomainService()... and
	getPrototypeRegistryService()... in ClusterImpl.

2001-08-07  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* PluginManager, ClusterImpl
	Move services such as BlackboardService, SchedulerService, etc to
	ClusterImpl so that they can become services provided by the
	AgentServiceBroker. This removes some dependencies of
	PluginManager on ClusterImpl being passed into the constructor.

	* MessageTransportService, Binders, Node, etc
	Hookup MessageTransportService and get rid of pass thru methods of
	getMessageTransportServer() and sendMessage() in various binders
	and components.  This work was done with John Zinky and Rich Shapiro.
	
2001-08-02  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MessageTransportServerImpl
	Made class public so that introspective constructor and
	initialization will work.

	* BinderFactory, BinderFactorySupport, ServiceFilter, ContainerSupport
	getBinder now takes only one argument - the BindingSite class
	argument was dropped, as the binder is always the one to need to
	make the decision anyway.
	
	* ContainerSupport, PluginManager, Agent, AgentManager, MessageTransportServerImpl, Node
	Dropped specifyChildBindingSite() method and data member, as the
	values were always ignored. 

2001-07-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com> (For Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com)

	* Node, AgentManager, Agent, PluginManager, etc
	Implemented ServiceBroker transitivity: e.g. plugins can request
	and receive Node-level services.

	* Agent, AgentBinder, AgentBindingSite, ClusterImpl
	Agent (ClusterImpl) is now a Container.

	* AgentManager, ClusterManagermentServesCluster, AgentManagerBinder*, AgentManagerForBinder
	AgentManager is an intermediate container between Node and Agent.

	* Node, NodeForBinder
	Node is now a Container.	

2001-07-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ServiceFilterBinder
	Very flexible base class for a wrapping binder that watches
	and optionally modifies service requests.  See
	../examples/org/cougaar/core/examples/PluginServiceFilter 
	for an example.

	* BinderSupport
	Support for WrappingBinders

	* BinderWrapper
	New base class for binders of binders.

	* BinderBase
	New base class for BinderSupport and new BinderWrapper.

2001-07-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* GenericStateModel
	load() no longer takes an argument.  PluginAdapter keeps support
	for one-argument load for backward compatability.

	* BindingUtilities
	A set of introspection-based utility methods for walking
	components and Binders through their activation states.

	* Binder
	Standard binder constructors now take a different pattern of
	arguments.  The first argument is the matching BinderFactory so
	that the binder can have access to binderFactory facilities, if
	desired. The second argument is the child as before.  Note that
	Wrapping binders would take the second argument as a Binder
	instead of Component.  The "parent" component is now set by
	setBindingSite - hopefully, this will be setContainerAPI by the 8.3
	release and retrieved by setContainerAPI. 

	* org.cougaar.core.component.*
	Binders are now responsible for construction of the Component the
	bind, usually with the help of a binderfactory.  Better
	conformance to the statemodel: binder chain is put together before
	initialize,load,start is called, and these messages propagate down
	the chain to keep proper nesting. 
	

2001-07-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ServiceFilter, ServiceFilterBinder
	Start of an example wrapping binder.  Not yet ready for prime time.

	* Binder, BinderFactory, ContainerAPI, etc
	More minor cleanup for consistency, safety.  getChildServiceBroker()
	is renamed getServiceBroker for consistency with other components.	

2001-07-19  Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	* ClusterImpl
	Hook in new services that were split out of ClusterImpl such as
	UIDService, DomainService and PrototypeRegistryService.
	Cluster is now a subclass of Agent and provides the above listed
	services to the AgentServiceBroker.

	* UIDServer, UIDService, etc
	No longer the UIDServer implementation. Instead it is a UIDService
	like interface for backwards compatability.  Can easily be removed
	to leave the UIDService interface and renamed implementation.

	* DomainService
	LDM Factory service.  Implemented as a service instead of part
	of ClusterImpl.

	* PrototypeRegistryService
	LDM Prototype provider registry services. Now implemented as a
	service instead of part of ClusterImpl.

	* AgentManager, AgentManagerServiceBroker, AgentBinder, etc
	New AgentManager shell and Binder support classes to bind the
	AgentManager with various Agents.

	* Agent, AgentServiceBroker, PluginManagerBinder, etc
	New base class for Agents along with PluginManagerBinder support 
	for binding Agents and PluginManagers.
	
2001-07-19  Todd Wright <twright@bbn.com>

        * INIParser, ClusterINIParser, NodeINIParser
        New ".ini" file parser that creates ComponentDescriptions, which
        replaces the old ClusterINIParser and NodeINIParser.
        The new format is "insertionPoint = classname(Vector of Strings)",
        with backwards compatibility for "cluster = " and "plugin = ".

        * Node
        Modified to use the new INIParser and ComponentDescriptions for 
        loading Components.  Currently only supports Clusters and children
        of PluginManager.

        * ExternalNodeController, AddClustersMessage
        Removed AddClustersMessage for future replacement with 
        ComponentMessage.

2001-07-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ServiceEvent, etc
	Raised getService from concrete classes into ServiceEvent.
	Cleaned up various servicebroker-related things to prepare the way
	for service transitivity and safer binders.
		
	* DelegatingServiceBroker
	ServiceBroker which delegates to another with no local storage,
	useful as a base class for restricting access to clients.

	* PropagatingServiceBroker
	ServiceBroker which will propagate queries to a higher authority
	if not satisfied locally.

	* PluginAdapter, DefaultPluginBinder
	Binder no longer needs ANY special case for PluginAdapter.

	* DefaultPluginBinderFactory, DefaultPluginBinder, PluginAdapter
	Drop need for PluginAdapterBinder.  Still need to port
	PluginAdapter's threading to new model.

	* BinderSupport
	make getBinderProxy() abstract to force binders to decide how much
	protection is appropriate.

	* AgentBinder, MessageTransportBinder
	define simple, low-quality getBinderProxy() methods

2001-07-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginManager
	Implement a real ContainerAPI proxy so that binders cannot
	downcast PluginManager and gain expanded access to the manager.
	Of particular concern were the set operations - e.g. without this,
	a binder could explore the local component hierarchy freely.

	* DefaultPluginBinderFactory
	Renamed PluginBinderFactory to DefaultPluginBinderFactory to be
	less judgmental.

	* PluginAdapter, PluginAdapterBinder
	Abstract out a placeholder LDM service for the real one to
	simplify overly complex PluginBindingSite and some avoid some
	back-door support for PluginAdapter.  This eliminates the last of
	the direct calls into cluster from PluginAdapter and allows
	fully-capable non-pluginadapter implementations.

	* ContainerSupport
	Make getContainerProxy abstract, forcing concrete classes to
	implement it explicitly.  This makes the default behavior much
	more likely to be secure. Matching updates in existing
	containers. 

	* ContainerAPI, Binder, etc
	Binders now talk to the containing component via ContainerAPI.
	This makes the interaction across this boundary much safer and
	controllable.  It also sets the stage for filtering binders and
	wrapping binders.  Various Binder implementations were updated to
	match the new interface.

	* BindingSite
	No longer extends Service - not required and may confuse matters.

	* ComponentDescription
	Changed interepretation of insertion point slightly, added name
	information. 

	* ContainerSupport, etc
	Changed method specifyChildContext() to
	specifyChildServiceBroker() and data member childContext to
	childServiceBroker for consistency.
	

2001-07-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFinder
	Allow -Dorg.cougaar.core.util.ConfigFinder.verbose=true to enable
	verbose mode.

2001-06-15 Beth DePass <bdepass@bbn.com>
	
	* ClusterImpl, SharedPluginManager, SharedThreadingService,
	PluginAdaper, etc
	Move Plugin shared threading to a service.  SharedPluginManager
	now implements SharedThreadingService.
	SharedThreadingServiceProvider
	is responsible for creating a SharedPluginManager for each
	cluster. There are no hooks to Shared Threading in Cluster or
	PluginManager now.


2001-05-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Add a default-enabled setting org.cougaar.message.lazyLookup which
	batches namespace lookups instead of having each destination queue
	do the job.  This can dramatically reduce the number of threads
	used in "cut down" societies, and is an expecially big win when
	useNodeDelivery=true or fastTransport=true.

2001-05-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DBConnectionPool
	Add additional debugging support when runtime-enabled.

	* ScoringFunction
	Cache Best points which had often been recomputed every time.

	* RMINameServer
	Implement a fast, RMI-less query path when the nameserver is in
	the same VM.

2001-04-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/util/TimeSpanSet.java:
	Bug #373
	Reimplement search as binary search to speed up insertions.

	* org/cougaar/util/MoreMath.java:
	Bug #372
	New method: nearlyEqual compares two doubles for near equality.
	Equality comparisons of doubles is instrinsically difficult
	because of rounding. This methods checks the relative difference
	between two doubles and their values. There are two versions, one
	with a fixed tolerance of one part per billion and one with a
	specifiable tolerance.

2001-04-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResultAggregator
	Aggregate only results actually reported.  Actually has a
	significantly lower memory load then before as well.
	Fixes bug 322. 

2001-04-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogPlan, Distributor, etc
	Added functionality to allow LPs to delay execution of a body of
	code until the end of the LP transaction.  The most important use
	of this is to "roll up" redundant operations into fewer
	operations).

2001-04-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Add support for org.cougaar.core.node.bootstrapper.loud={false,true,shout}.
	false, the default, leaves behavior untouched.  true dumps the
	ordered list of jar,zip,directorys searched by the classloader at
	startup time. shout additionally lists the file used to load every
	class loaded by the bootstrap classloader. (bug 299)

2001-04-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP.java:
	Suppress DeferredRescind failed message. This is innocuous and
	happens when a TaskRescind is repeated as part of rehydration
	recovery.
	Force remove of plan element added after its task has been
	rescinded. Because of timing issues, the plan element may not be
	in the PlanElementSet, but may need to be removed anyway.

2001-04-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/domain/planning/ldm/lps/RescindLP.java:
	Suppress DeferredRescind failed message. This is innocuous and

	recovery.
	Force remove of plan element added after its task has been

2001-03-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Domain, DomainManager, ClusterImpl
	Support optional domain-name aliases for Domains.  See Domain
	javadoc for information.
	
2001-03-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* unalp
	Removed remaining references to ALP from codebase. See
	core/doc/CHANGES and core/doc/8.0/unalp for info.

2001-03-28  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Persistence
	Modifications to reduce creation of byte arrays during
	persistence. Requested by Mark Sutterlin. For large deltas, these
	arrays consume lots of memory and having multiple copies of the
	same information is problematic. Instead, serialized data is
	streamed directly to the output stream. In the case of database
	persistence, the outputstream streams directly to the database as
	well.

	* EnvelopeTuple
	Bug #181
	Check nullity of arguments in constructors of EnvelopeTuple to
	catch bogus objects sooner. Throws IllegalArgumentException.
	BulkEnvelopeTuple also checks objects when dispensing the objects,
	but not in the constructor due to the cost.

2001-03-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* rmi
	generate only 1.2 and later stubs rather than the old 1.1 RMI
	protocol, too.

	* version.def
	Bump version 8.0, even though we are still officially only at
	7.3. 

2001-03-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* version.def
	Bump version to 7.2.0.

2001-03-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPPlan
	Modified sendDirective variations to throw an
	IllegalArgumentException when called with null.  This lets us know
	where the real problem lays rather than getting a NPE when the
	directive queue is emptied.  Fixes bug 182

2001-03-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* IncrementalSubscription
	Changes get*Collection accessors to return empty collections
	rather than nulls.  Bug 164.

2001-03-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PublishException -- et. al.
	Add boolean to PublishException indicating whether the lack of a
	prior publisher is because prior publishers are not being saved or
	because there was not prior publisher. The exception message
	reflects this difference.

	* release
	Released MB 7.0.1
	
2001-02-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>
	
	* SharedPluginManager
	Upped warning time to 2 minutes.  Changable via 
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPluginManager.warningTime=N where
	N is milliseconds the plugin has to run before being suspect.
	Also aded a control for dumping the stats file separate from
	collection. -Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.SharedPluginManager.dumpStatistics=false

	* org.cougaar.util.PropertyParser
	Finally created this utility for parsing out values of various
	types from java.util.Properties.  By default, takes from System
	properties.  Doesn't reimplement facilities already found
	elsewhere, e.g. getString and no-default property getters.

	* PublishHistory
	New facility to assist in debugging publishing errors.

	PublishHistory keeps a stack dump for the most recent add, change,
	and publish events for an object. The stack dumps are flushed
	after a minute of inactivity for the object. The stack dumps for
	any particular object may be dumped as needed.
	
	A PublishHistory object may be instantiated in the Distributor and
	accessed from the Subscriber (for saving publishing events) and
	from the ALPPlan. The interfaces for the ALPPlan and LogPlan have
	been augmented to allow the history object to be retrieved.
	
	The ComplainingLP has been modified to use to dump the recent
	stack traces for objects about which it complains.

	The history object is only instantiated if
	-Dorg.cougaar.core.cluster.publishHistory=true

2001-02-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SharedPluginManager
	I just checked in some new facilities useful for debugging and
	performance analysis.  The basic idea is to watch how simple
	plugins are scheduled: we can watch how long "Shared Thread"
	plugins take to execute and keep statistics.  We also watch to see
	if plugins block or otherwise fail to return from execute(). 
	
	org.cougaar.core.agent.service.sharedthreading.SharedPluginManager.statistics=false Set
	it to true to get periodic dumps of plugin statistics to the file
	<NODENAME>.statistics in the current directory.  Requires that the
	watcher be enabled in order to actually get the output, but
	perhaps some metrics display should get access to the info. 

	org.cougaar.core.agent.service.sharedthreading.SharedPluginManager.watching=true Set it
	to false to disable the watcher (default is enabled). When enabled,
	will complain whever it sees a plugin run or block for more than
	15 seconds.  It will also cause the above statistics file(s) to be
	(re)generated approximately every two minutes.  The watcher is one
	thread per vm, so it isn't too expensive.

	* DBConnectionPool
	Retry getConnection and createStatement on known possibly
	continuable exceptions.  Also reap idle connections after
	only 10 seconds.

2001-02-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DBConnectionPool
	Add control parameters and debugging support.

2001-02-15  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DeletionPlugin
	Add DeletionPolicy for specifying deletion delay for classes of
	Tasks. A DeletionPolicy has three RuleParameters: a
	PredicateRuleParameter for selecting Tasks, a LongRuleParameter
	for specifying the deletion delay and a IntegerRuleParameter for
	specifying a priority. DeletionPolicies are used in descending
	order of priority until one is found that matches a task and the
	association deletion delay is added to the task end time to
	determine when the task can be deleted.

	A DefaultDeletionPolicy is used if no other DeletionPolicy is
	found.

	* PredicateRuleParameter
	New RuleParameter holding a UnaryPredicate. "In range" means the
	predicate returns true.

	* LongRuleParameter
	New RuleParameter a la IntegerRuleParameter holding longs instead
	of ints.

2001-02-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org.cougaar.util.DBConnectionPool
	Promoted delta's connection pool manager to util.

2001-02-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetTransferLP and ReceiveAssetTransferLP
	New relationship schedules are only sent if changes show the
	presence of a
	RelationshipSchedule.RelationshipScheduleChangeReport. If no
	schedule is received, the relationships are left alone; only
	property groups are update.

2001-01-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Added ComplainingLP
	Error checking LP complains about problematic LogPlan changes
	such as publishChanging an object which isn't in the plan.  Since
	LPs are applied after subscription changes, they cannot do things
	like check for redundant adds or removes - sigh.

2001-01-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org.cougaar.util.Parameters
	More extensive Parameter File handling.  Now reads
	"$home/.cougaarrc" *and* searches the config path for "cougaar.rc"
	in addition to searching for .alprc in the usual places.  .alprc
	processing will, of course, be dropped at some point.

2001-01-05  Noelle Givler <ngivler@bbn.com>
	* org.cougaar.planning.ldm.plan.Schedule

	Changes to the 7.0 tree designed to make access to 
	org.cougaar.planning.ldm.plan.Schedule and extenders thread 
	safe. The changes should be transparent with one exception - 
	Schedule.iterator() now returns an Iterator over a copy of the 
	schedule. Calls to Iterator.remove() will not affect the schedule and
	changes to the schedule while the Iterator is being used will not be
	visible. This change was introduced to prevent the 
	ComodificationExceptions we were seeing last year. 

	Calls to Schedule.iterator() also print a stack trace to System.err. 
	To avoid stack trace (and to make the code more explicit), you can 
	copy the schedule to an ArrayList before iterating. The following code
	returns a copy of the entire schedule.
	
	  ArrayList copy = new ArrayList(schedule);

	
	If you are iterating over the schedule and screening at each step, 
	you can create an UnaryPredicate which performs the screen and then
	call Schedule.filter(UnaryPredicate). The following code example uses
	a UnaryPredicate to find all AssignedAvailabilityElements and then
	calls Schedule.removeAll to remove the elements from the schedule.
	
	  Collection remove = availSchedule.filter(new UnaryPredicate()  {
            public boolean execute(Object o) {
              return (o instanceof AssignedAvailabilityElement)
	    }
	  });
	  availSchedule.removeAll(remove);


	
2000-11-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.OptionPane
	This is a replacement for JOptionPane that fixes the workaround
	for bug#4135218. That workaround computes a static adjustment of
	the preferred size of the JOptionPane inside a JDialog. The static
	adjustment fails to account for UI changes such as those used to
	make fonts bigger in demo mode.

	alp.util.OptionPane extends JOptionPane and supplies replacements
	for the two basic methods: showOptionPane and showInputPane. It
	does not furnish replacements for the convenience versions of
	these methods having fewer arguments or with certain defaults.
	Since static methods can't be overridden, to use this replacement,
	you must use the full blown basic methods.

2000-11-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AlertParameter
	Add isVisible, setVisible, isEditable, and setEditable. Invisible
	parameters can be used to carry information that doesn't need/want
	to be displayed. Editable parameters can be used to all the
	operator to alter values.

	* AllocationResult
	Fix Bug 61, range check of aspect type.

2000-10-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceInputStream
	Use introspection rather than superclass calls so that we can
	avoid all sorts of compile-time complexity with javaiopatch.
	The result is that while javaiopatch is still required in
	bootclasspath at runtime when persistence is activated, it is no
	longer required at compile time.

2000-10-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence
	Provide a ClusterContext for rehydration so that Assets, for
	instance, are reattached to the local LDM.  To deserialization
	methods, the situation will appear as though they were being
	deserialized within a message from the cluster to itself.

	* Subscriber
	Disable, by default, unpublished change warnings.
	-Dalp.subscriber.warnUnpublishChanges=true will re-enable them.

2000-10-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Subscriber
	Use the right accessor to find the correct transaction to get the
	unposted change reports to avoid potentially very confusing
	warnings (phew!).

	* ALPPlan, LogPlan
	Plug a memory leak.  Also minor cleanup.

2000-10-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ObjectInputStream
	Moved to javaiopatch module.

2000-10-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSet, ClusterImpl, DomainManager, Registry, RootFactory
	Back off use of StringKey.  AssetSet was the only remaining
	high-bandwidth user of StringKey.  My suspicion is that the
	speedup on non-hotspot VMs is propably below the waterline and the 
	slowdown on hotspotful VMs is a win, especially in reduced consing 
	costs.  We'll not re-insert this optimization without re-analysis
	of actual performance, as even micro-benchmarks show interpreted
	performace, e.g. within optimiz-it, as artificially widening the
	gap on VMs which have String.hashCode problem.

2000-10-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* EssentialAssetFactory
	Added hashCode and equals methods.

	* RootFactory
	Redundantly adding asset/pg factories quietly tolerated.
	Added containsPropertyGroupFactory and containsAssetFactory
	methods as a preferred way to tell if a factory is already
	loaded. addPropertyGroupFactory now allows passing in the class
	in addition to an instance, since only the class is ever used.
	Also cleaned out some old code.

2000-10-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Extend the list of classes not loaded by the custom classloader.
	Also provide a method to extend the list.  See Bootstrapper
	javadoc for details.

	* alp.society.LsNS
	A mini-application which recursively prints the entire contents of 
	the NameServer.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Support a variety of toggles which control how message queues map
	to threads and RMI server objects.  Should be considered
	experimental as this point, but may eventually become the default.
	To activate, set alp.message.fastTransport=true.
	Results in reduced threading and better network multiplexing, so
	should result in lower overall network cost, especially for
	societies where nodes have many clusters.  Minimal or zero benefit 
	for societies where each node supports a single cluster.
	
	See javadoc or core/doc/ReleaseNotes/CHANGES for more info.

2000-10-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Bootstrapper
	Can be used as a top-level bootstrapper for arbitrary classes.
	First argument specifies the class, the rest are passed to the
	public static method class.launch or class.main.

2000-10-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence
	Only one cluster of a node at a time may be actively persisting at 
	once.  What a sad hack... sigh.

	* Node
	System property alp.useBootstrapper=false can be used to
	circumvent the bootstrapper and the jar-file search.  Of course,
	this means that the incoming classpath needs to be correctly set
	up before invocation.  Users of IDEs may want to invoke
	Node.launch instead of Node.main as an alternative way of
	circumventing the custom classloader.

	* EventEnvelopeTuple, EventSubscription
	Initial infrastructure for non-persistent event distribution
	between intra-cluster entities handling in-band with respect to
	transactions. The goal is to make alarm/wake/timer events be
	handled this way.

2000-09-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Node
	Node now re-launches itself using Bootstrapper.  This allows huge
	simplification of the startup scripts and makes it reasonable to
	have some basic scripts in the core bin directory.
	
	* Bootstrapper
	Searches a predicable set of locations and then launches a class
	(main-like) using a custom classloader.
	
	* UID
	Smaller datastructure with full backward compatability.  Now
	stores "FOO" and a long instead of "FOO/<long>".

2000-09-25  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.Random
	Extends java.util.Random to add nextPoisson(double mean) that
	returns a random deviate drawn from a Poisson distribution having
	the specified mean.

	* alp.util.MoreMath
	Additional math functions. Specifically, gammaLn computes the
	natural log of the gamma function. Useful for statistical
	calculations (see alp.util.Random).

2000-09-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Measure, Derivative
	Support a richer API for gui and closer-to-measure-neutral use
	without requiring introspection.

	* measures.def
	Minor changes to Speed et al - add some units, drop others.

2000-09-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DomainManager
	Also looks in config file LDMDomains.ini to find domain
	specifications. Added one in alpine configs/common and updated
	scripts.  Also copied some basic scripts over to core/bin so that
	there is something useful there for the COUGAAR distribution.

	* Bootstrapper, Node
	Bootstrapper implements a special classloader, then launches the
	specified class using that loader.  Allows searching for all
	appropriate jar files.  Would be good to implement node-level jar
	authentication at this point.  Node now uses Bootstrapper.

2000-09-20  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.cluster
	Added longer schedule of execution timer changes so that more
	complex patterns of execution time can be specified. Added
	interface for specifying a series of time changes that are
	consistent with each other, e.g., "In 5 seconds change to rate
	1440 for 25 seconds and then switch to rate 1.0".

2000-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.measure
	Added Measure and Derivative interfaces.  Updated AbstractMeasure
	to match. Updated measures.def to take advantage of new features
	of MeasureWriter.  In particular, Rate is now an interface rather
	than a class.  The old Rate class functionality is now AbstractRate.

	* alp.persist*.*
	Rename alp.persist2.* to alp.persist.*.

2000-09-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Transaction
	Finally, a real Transaction abstraction.  Supports ChangeReport
	collection per object.  Stores reference in a thread-local
	variable to make sure it is available to all.
	
	* Update
	ALPPlan, Subscriber, PublishableAdapter, Publishable to use
	Transaction.  PublishableAdapter now uses the Transaction
	mechanism for ChangeReport collection.	Subscriber may choose the
	Transaction class to use to support fancier interation mechanisms:
	e.g. for whatif.  Complains if there are outstanding changes left
	on transaction close.

	Removed noteChangeReport from PublishableAdapter and updated
	TaskImpl and PlanElementImpl to call Transaction.noteChangeReport
	directly.
	
2000-08-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResultAggregator, TaskScoreTable
	Performance improvements. Bug 32.

2000-08-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ExecutionTimer et. al.
	Multiple files changed to implement variable rate execution clock.
	The current execution time is computed as
	System.currentTimeMillis() * rate + offset. The API allows the
	rate and offset to be changed as well as specify the time at which
	the change is to take effect. Time parameter changes are strictly
	ordered so that only the dominant change needs to be kept.

	* PlanElement et. al.
	Multiple files changed to add observed allocation results. Tasks
	now have "observable aspects" such that observed results of these
	aspects can created. The observed results are merged with other
	received (not observed) results to form the reported results.

2000-08-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFinder
	If alp.config is not defined the value "common" is used instead of
	minitestconfig. This means that, usually, no config files will be
	found unless they are in "." or $HOME/.alp since the standard
	alp.config.path will simply include $INSTALL/configs/common twice.
	This was done to reduce the surprise when config files are found
	in minitestconfig when that isn't the actual configuration being
	used.

2000-08-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	implement Publishable.

	* ALPPlan, LogPlan
	Fix stupid infinite loop while calling getWorkflowCount.

	* Debug, etc
	Eliminate unused references to Debug facility.

	* Citizen, ClusterProfile, Node
	Clean up - remove Citizen, simplify other code to prepare for app
	server merge

2000-08-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Timer, RealTimer, ExecutionTimer
	Renamed ScenarioTimer to ExecutionTimer.  Extended Timer with
	RealTimer and made the base class abstract.  Updated ClusterImpl.

	* Communications
	Fix bug where -ns argument to Node was not functional.
	Expand syntax allowed for alp.name.server to allow for full
	specification: e.g. host[:port[:lpsport]].  -ns just sets
	alp.name.server so has the same syntax.

2000-08-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* QuerySubscription, PluginAdapter, Subscriber, Distributor, ALPPlan
	Make query() avoid most subscription overhead.

2000-08-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* HysteresisProvider, SubscriptionEnvelope:
 	Removed as they are no longer supported anyway.

2000-08-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CollectionSubscription
	Now implements and advertises Collection.

	* CollectionSubscription
	When using a DynamicUnaryPredicate, alters its behavior so that it 
	attempts to handle implicit adds and removes of objects in
	response to change reports.  This is rather more expensive than
	the standard UnaryPredicate case, so should only be used with cause.

	* *EnvelopeTuple, Subscription, et.al.
	Move the predicate testing logic from the tuple into the
	subscription.  While this does not change the logic flow, it moves 
	the boundaries around a little both to make things a little more
	OO-orderly, as well as to make the new DynamicUnaryPredicate
	handling implementation simpler.  Essentially, what used to happen 
	was:
		AddEnvelopeTuple.applyToSubscription()
		  if(Subscription.getPredicate().execute())
		    Subscription.privateAdd()
	now:
		AddEnvelopeTuple.applyToSubscription()
		  Subscription.conditionalAdd()
		    if (predicate.execute())
		      privateAdd();
	
	This also lets us keep the subscription predicate non-public.
	
	* DynamicUnaryPredicate
	Marker for a UnaryPredicate which tests for mutable properties of
	objects. 
	
	* SimpleSubscription, Subscriber
	remove SimpleSubscription.  Just use CollectionSubscription
	instead: Subscriber so modified.

	* CollectionSubscription
	Make it non-abstract.
	
2000-08-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogicProvider, alp.cluster.*
	Allow for a consistent logic-provider threading model.  In
	particular, LPs have always operated on a sub-transaction basis,
	yet the products of LPs have not been available to themselves
	until the end of the transaction.  The new behavior allows LPs to
	immediately effect the logplan via add/remove/change so that
	ALPPlan and XPlan subscriptions are visibly updated.  This change
	should not alter extra-LP visibility at all.

2000-08-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Verb, Role, etc
	Add back various serialization optimizations which had been
	implemented by Object{Input,Output}StreamWithContext.
	
	* ObjectInputStreamWithContext, ObjectOutputStreamWithContext 
	Removed now unused classes and cut dangling imports.  

	* ALPObjectStream, ComplexObject, MessageContext, alp.io.*
	More serialization cleanup.  Removed classes, no longer need
	the package. Remove old import references.

2000-08-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.(various)
	Changed implementations so that they no longer key off of
	AlpObject*Stream instances.  Occasionally check for persistence
	streams, sometimes check context, e.g. for Asset.  Most of these
	could now be further simplified to use default serialization
	instead of needing transients and custom read/riteObject methods.

	* alp.persist
	Dropped most of ancient persistence implementation, which had been 
	subject to extensive bit rot and depended on ALPObject*Stream
	functionality. 
	
	* ALPObject*Stream, etc.
	Dropped ALPObjectInputStream, ALPObjectOutputStream in favor of
	lighter-weight context discovery mechanism using thread-local
	variables.  See ClusterContextTable statics for implementation
	and DirectiveMessage for use.  Left are the implementations of
	ObjectInput/OutputStreamWithContext for reference on some
	potential optimizations to add back at a later point.  These
	optimizations need to be reexamined anyway as they are likely to
	be stale by now.

	
2000-08-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* properties.def
	Disable DataQuality support for all core PGs.

	* PropertyGroup
	add boolean hasDataQuality() method.

	* alp.ldm.dq.DataQuality, HasDataQuality, NewHasDataQuality
	DataQuality support classes.

2000-08-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* measures.def
	Use new MeasureWriter features to better define CostRate, Speed,
	MassTransferRate, FlowRate.  Added TimeRate to support "time
	consumed for an activity per time unit".  

	Replaced bogus Volume.TONS with Volume.MTONS with the correct
	value.  The old TONS was equivalent to 100 cubic feet.

2000-07-26  Jim Winston <jwinston@bbn.com>

	* alp.ui.planserver.server, alp.ui.planserver.server.slp
	Silenced verbose messages to System.out
	
2000-07-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Task, NewTask, TaskImpl
	Add support for EventGenerator: addObservableAspect and
	getObservableAspects allow specification and retrieval of the
	aspects of the allocation result of the disposition of the task
	that can be observed in reports generated by the event generator.

2000-07-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterContextTable, DirectiveMessage
	Beginnings of eliminating the nested serialization stream for
	directive/cluster messages.  This change is just to support the
	new Thread-local state on serialization/deserialization -- no old
	functionality has been removed.

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Fix bug where setFooPG with a non-immediate slot can result in
	multiple versions of the PG on the otherPGs list.  We now will
	replace the first matching PG rather than blindly adding it.
	May result in a very slight performance hit with long PG lists,
	but much more correct.  Also tweak synchronization slightly to
	improve correctness and safety.

2000-07-14  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* IncrementalSubscription, SortedSubscription
	New subscription class that returns elements() and getAddedList()
	in sorted order. IncrementSubscription modified to expose creation
	of the added set so that the SortedSubscription subclass can
	override to create a SortedSet. Other methods of
	IncrementalSubscription are overridden to detect changes that
	might disorder the collection.

2000-07-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset, RootFactory
	Simplify LDM registration process.  For non-factories Asset
	instance registration, just call asset.registerWithLDM(ldm)
	instead of setUID(nextUID) and bindToLDM(ldm);

2000-07-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.Stack
	Removed.  Hasn't been used since pre-jdk1.2 days.

	* ClusterServesPlugin, ClusterImpl
	Provide ConfigFinder instance to plugins for forward
	compatability.  Current implementation just returns the
	singleton. 

	* ConfigFinder, ConfigFileFinder
	Merge in ZIP file support from susan.

2000-06-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFinder, ConfigFileFinder
	new class ConfigFinder is a non-static, more generalized version
	of ConfigFileFinder.  ConfigFileFinder has been updated to use the 
	singleton version of ConfigFinder.

2000-06-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Communications
	Fix selection of message transports.  There is still plenty of
	opportunity for cleanup here.

	* DirectiveMessage
	Comment out the checks and calls to exit so that we can again run
	multi-node on the same machine.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Don't generate an exception when a name lookup returns null.

	* alp.util.Reflect
	Add memoized Constructor retrieval and getMethod, getConstructor
	methods which return null rather than exceptions on not finding
	the appropriate item in the class.

2000-06-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Added optimistic persistence support. This allows for rehydration
	from persistence information that is not in sync with the state of
	other clusters. Discrepancies are reconciled by resending Tasks,
	AssetAssignments, and TransferableTransfers to insure that other
	clusters have the objects implied by the rehydrated state and by
	sending Notifications, AssetVerifications, and
	TransferableVerifications for objects in the rehydrated state of
	the cluster. The other clusters rescind any object mentioned in
	the verification message that is not current.

	* MessageManagerImpl
	Detect restarted clusters and initiate the resynchronization process.

2000-06-14  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Make slightly more modular to support subclassing in order to add
	QUO-style rmi proxies.  An example of client-side use is supplied
	in a comment.  Added generateServerSideProxy and
	generateClientSideProxy methods.

2000-06-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* various
	Remove double-check tricks to avoid sync because it is subtly
	dangerous: out-of-order constructor/assign execution can result in 
	visibility of pre-constructor-called objects.

2000-06-02  Beth DePass  <bdepass@bbn.com>
  
	* Workflow and Composition isPropagating changes
	Default for propagation flag is now TRUE.
	Setter for propagating flag on workflows and compositions now
	takes a boolean argument instead of being a one time setter.
	Old setters are deprecated for now.
	Workflows and their subtasks, regardless of the value of the 
	propagation flag, are no longer published as a result of an expansion
	being published.
	Workflows are no longer active subscription objects.
	All active subscription removal logic that was in WorkflowImpl
	(that is still valid) has been moved up to ExpansionImpl.
	SimplePlugin and the helper classes have been updated/added to
	to not call setispropagating as the default is now true.
	SimplePlugin and the helper classes have been updated/added to 
	with publishAddExpansion(subscriber, planelement) which now publishes the
	expansion planelement AND any subtasks on the workflow.


2000-05-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Directive
	Require that all directives are Serializable.  Fixes serialization 
	of DirectiveWithChangeReports bug.

2000-05-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Merge in changes from ALP6.2 (stable) up to ALP62M1 merge point.

2000-05-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TimeAspectValue
	Add a timeValue alias for longValue.

2000-05-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Task, NewTask, TaskImpl
	Collect detailed changeReports for preference modifications

	* ChangeReport, et.al.
	Detailed ChangeReport support, with LP and messaging complete.
	
2000-05-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* alp.cluster.ALPPlan etc.
	LogPlan-like objects need to be domain-specific. Because the
	collection of domains is arbitrary, cannot use
	inheritance. Instead LogPlan and similar "XPlans" must implement
	XPlanServesALPPlan and must be created by the Domain. XPlans
	delegate the ALPPlanServesLogicProvider methods the the underlying
	ALPPlan.

2000-05-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.asset.PGDelegate
	Required interface for BehaviorGroup delegation.  See 
	ReleaseNotes/ALP6.2/BehaviorGroups.txt for details.
	
2000-05-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl
	Fix obscure bug which manifested when using a UI to examine tasks
	with preferences but no prepositional phrases and which had been
	serialized.

	* Simplified*Plugin
	deprecated.  Better to use SimplePlugin et al.

	* EssentialPlugin
	Removed. Ancient, easy to break, incomplete... gone.

	* TaskImpl, PlanElementImpl
	Fix references to static inner classes of interfaces so that javac 
	can compile these guys.

	* PublishableAdapter
	Base class to help implementing Publishable.

	* ChangeReport, Publishable
	Moved to alp.cluster from alp.ldm.plan.

	* Task
	ChangeReport support for tasks.

2000-05-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlanElementImpl
	Basic ChangeReport collection functionality and an initial
	low-fidelity cut at AllocationResult change reports.

	* PlanElement
	Make Publishable, add pseudo-inner classes implement ChangeReport.

	* AspectType
	Add UNDEFINED value and make comments javadoc complient.

	* Subscriber
	Clear changereports on publishAdd, complain if there are
	outstanding ChangeReports on publishRemove.

	* IncrementalSubscription
	Add Collection-returning accessors for delta lists.

2000-04-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPPlan
	Provide ChangeReport change api for LPs.

	* persist2/BasePersistence
	Tweak for new EnvelopeTuple implementations.

	* ExpanderHelper, AllocatorHelper
	Adjust some helpers to call a more direct change propagation
	method.  For now, the helper methods depend on automatic
	changereport collection.  They may need to provide different
	information at some point.

	* PluginAdapter, PluginDelegate
	Convenience methods for accessing the new Subscriber publishChange 
	API.  While plugins could use the Subscriber methods themselves,
	in practice, most will want to use the slightly-more-convenient
	delagating methods here.  In effect, this is the
	"producer-of-change" end of the change propagation API.

	* Subscriber
	Extend publishChange to collect ChangeReports from Publishable
	objects and from an optional extra argument to propagate to change 
	consumers.  

	* CollectionSubscription
	Collect ChangeReports from ChangeEnvelopeTuples and make 'em
	available to subscription clients.  This facility could go
	elsewhere, but this seems to be as good as any.  Other obvious
	choices are either at Subscription (the base class) or at
	IncrementalSubscription.  This is the "consumer-of-change" side of 
	the change propagation API.

	* Subscription, et.al.
	Make the privateChange API take a second argument always.  There
	is no need for a convenience function because this is *very*
	internal. 

	* Envelope, PersistenceEnvelope
	Simplify and delegate more behavior to the EnvelopeTuples. 
	
	* *EnvelopeTuple
	Moved tuple types into separate classes.  Significantly improves
	clarity and probably improves performance by reducing the size of
	a tuple.  Also, each tuple now performs the subscription
	modifications rather than the Envelope doing the job.

	* Publishable, ChangeReport
	Basic new classes for change tracking facility.  Publishable has
	some persistence functionality which I can no longer remember the
	appropriate description of.

2000-04-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LatePropertyProvider, et.al.
	Full support for Late-binding PropertyProviders, Null_PG and
	Future_PG implementations.

	* AssetSkeletonBase, Asset*
	Rewrite of PG resolution.  Much cleaner supporting late binding,
	futures, nulls, simpler prototype relationships.  Not yet
	optimized/tuned.

2000-04-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetWriter
	Support for dealing with Null_PG values and serialization of
	NullPGs and Future_PGs.

	* PGWriter
	All machine-generated PGs build both Future and Null variations.
	FooPG.nullPG holds a static "NullPG" value.  FooPG.Future is
	always a class which implements both FooPG and Future_PG.

	* Future_PG
	Base interface for "Future" PGs: PGs which are temporary
	placeholders for the "real" PG values.  See examples for more
	information. Use of futurePG accessors block until "finalized"
	with a real value.  Plugins emitting Future_PG instances must
	have their own thread to prevent deadlocks.

	* Null_PG
	Base interface for "Null" PGs: PGs which are more-or-less PG-typed
	empty/illegal values.  Use to distinguish between possibly defined
	PGs (late-bound) and known-to-be-undefined PGs.
	
2000-04-19  Jim Winston <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* MPTaskImpl
	When setParentTasks() is called, if the Context of the MPTask is null,
	the Context of the MPTask is set to the union of the Contexts of the
	parent tasks. Only Contexts that are instances of ContextOfUIDs are included.
	The result is a new ContextOfUIDs that contains one instance of each UID
	contained in the parent tasks' ContextOfUIDs.

2000-04-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Add some convenience methods and tweak semantics slightly - see
	the new documentation.

2000-04-06  Jim Winston	 <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* Policy
	Added setContext() and getContext() methods

2000-03-31  Jim Winston	 <jwinston@bbn.com>
	* ContextOfUIDs
	New class. Implements Context. For use when Context of a task can be referenced
	by UIDs.
	
2000-03-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterObjectFactory
	createDisposition added, but leave createFailedDisposition, both
	for backward compatability and for convenience.	

	* Disposition
	Replace FailedDisposition with Disposition, which may be used both 
	for failure or vacuous success states.  Fixed various other
	classes to match.

2000-03-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Plugin*
	Add a nice little claim/unclaim feature to do the claiming
	gruntwork for you. Remember to check the return value of claim in
	case you happen not to have won the race.

	* Claimable, ClaimableImpl
	add boolean tryClaim method to atomically grab a claim on an object.

	* TimeSpanSet
	Now extend ArrayListFoundation to be sigificantly faster and
	smaller, since we are no longer a wrapper around an ArrayList.
	More improvements await.  Fixed up extending classes.

	* ArrayListFoundation
	Modified version of ArrayList to provide direct access to internal 
	structures for extending classes.	

2000-03-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* version.def
	update to version 6.1, and branched ALP 6.0

	* FailedDisposition
	Better name for FailedAllocation.	

	* alp.ldm.predicate
	New package has a bunch of useful predefined predicates suitable
	both for direct use and for subclassing.

2000-03-21  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Verb, Role, Preposition
	Move non-core constants to Domain.  See, for example,
	mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.Constants.

2000-03-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.plugin.Plugin, PluginContext, et.al.
	Full support for stateless plugins.  See documentation in
	alp.plugin.Plugin for information.	

	* RoleSchedule, et.al.
	Use Collections API, extends TimeSpanSet.
	Renamed getRoleSchedule to getRoleSheduleElements.
	deprecated all Date-based methods. 
	Simplified implementation.

	* PEBinaryPredicate, StartDateBinaryPredicate
	removed.

	* Collectors
	Remove JGL support.

	* ScheduleImpl
	Correct semantics of getEndTime, getEndDate.

	* Filters
	Some careful optimizations to avoid consing new empty collections, 
	and cheaper operation on lists.

	* ScheduleUtilities
	Rewrite of many old methods.  The rest should also be
	rewritten. addOrSubtractToThisSchedule functionality has been
	moved to addSchedules and subtractSchedules methods.

	* Schedule
	extends Collection to integrate with other Collections.
	extends TimeSpan so you can compare whole schedules or have a
	schedule of schedules.
	addOrSubtractToThisSchedule functionality has been moved to
	ScheduleUtilities.

	* Schedule, ScheduleImpl, ScheduleUtilities, etc
	Schedules are now JDK Collection-based.  All methods with JGL
	arguments or return-values have been removed.  Date-based methods
	are all deprecated in favor of long millis methods.
	SimpleScheduleFoo methods are removed.

2000-03-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.TimeSpanSet
	Basic building block for schedules.  Maintains a sorted list of
	implementations of TimeSpan objects.  Not very efficient right now,
	but the API is pretty much correct and the implementation can be
	fixed with binary instead of sequential searching, some special
	cases for copy and compare, and perhaps doing internal array
	management instead of using an ArrayList for the actual storage.	

	* alp.util.TimeSpan
	Abstraction of objects with a temporal extent.  The generic
	schedule collection will operate on TimeSpan elements.

2000-03-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Annotatable
	Abstraction of plan objects with Annotation.  Decided to simplify
	things with the new interface.

	* Context
	Allow tasks to have a planning context attached.  This is intended 
	to allow, for instance, the Logistics Domain to attach an Oplan ID 
	to tasks to indicate which Oplan the task is supporting.

	* Subscription, et.al.
	Remove JGL from all subscription-related code.  Uses JDK
	Collections Framework instead.

2000-03-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter.query()
	API for future light-weight query of LogPlan.

	* UnaryPredicate
	New class: staging for removal of JGL.

2000-03-06  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.plugin.Annotation, Task, Workflow, PlanElement
	Allow the constructing plugin to tag certain LDM objects with a
	plugin-specified state object (Annotation).  See Annotation
	for more information.	

	* DomainManager
	Get collections of known domains by name or value.

	* RMINameServer
	Automatically start the nameserver when local and couldn't contact 
	it the first time around.  May be disabled by alp.nameserver.auto=false

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterIdentifier.toString
	no longer puts <> around the name.

	* VersionWriter, MeasureWriter, AssetWriter, PGWriter
	moved to build module, all in the alp.build package.
	Updated .def files appropriately.

	* alp.ldm.policy, alp.ldm.trigger
	Move these packages up a level from alp.ldm.plan.
	Moved Ship and StockageLevel policies to logistics domain.

2000-03-02  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Various
	Make sure core doesn't use now moved classes.
	
	* alp.ldm.asset, alp.ldm.plan, alp.ldm.oplan
	Move ALP-specific domain objects to mil.darpa.log.alp.domain.

	* Factory
	Remove all methods from interface.  Implementations are free to
	add whatever methods which are required.  Otherwise, plugins
	should use RootFactory for asset construction.
	
	* Domain
	Change the LogicProvider insertion api to construct the LPs and
	pass them back to the cluster for insertion into the LogPlan
	rather than to require the Domain method to insert them. This
	allows LogPlan.addLogicProvider to not be public.

2000-03-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.plan
	remove FGI-specific domain objects

	* Claimable, ClaimableImpl
	Moved from alp.ldm.plan to alp.cluster.

	* Message
	make Message classes concrete: Impl classes renamed to be the
	primary classes, interfaces dropped.
	
	Moved ClusterMessage, AckDirectiveMessage, DirectiveMessage,
	AdvanceClockMessage to alp.cluster.
	
 	Moved Add/RemovePlugin to alp.plugin. 

	* alp.ldm.plan.Predicate
	remove redundant class.

	* alp.ldm.asset.AssetIntrospection
	moved from alp.ldm.plan.

	* alp.util.PropertyNameValue
	moved from alp.ldm.plan.

	* alp.util.XMLizer
	renamed alp.ldm.plan.XMLPlanObjectConverter.

	* alp.util.XMLizable
	renamed alp.ldm.plan.XMLPlanObject.	

2000-02-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDMServesClient, ClusterServesPlugin
	Extends from ClusterContext to reduce redundancy in method specs.
	It would be nice to get rid of some of the extras in ClusterContext.

	* LdmFactory
	Add back a deprecated LdmFactory interface to provide some measure 
	of backward compatability so that we can put off large quantities
	of plugin rewriting a little longer.

2000-02-28  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Manage Domain factories for plugins, interface to Domains, load
	LPs through domains, etc.  This completes the infrastructure part
	of the first cut at Pluggable domains.

	* LDM
	Updates to make use of the below.

	* LDMServesClient
	New base interface for various others to extend with common methods.

	* RootFactory
	Replacement instantiable class for old LdmFactory.  Implements all 
	the required asset functionality including support for additional
	Asset and PG factories.  RootFactory is the LDM factory for the
	Root Domain - see above.

	* Factory
	Base interface API for all LDM Factories.  Just the basics -
	assumes only asset api is available, presumably often via
	delegation.

	* LdmFactory, SelfBeanInfo, LdmObject
	Removed.

	* SelfDescribingBeanInfo
	moved from alp.ldm to alp.util.

2000-02-25  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Task
	changed getParentTask() to getParentTaskUID().  MPTask and
	Workflow still have parent *tasks* since they don't generally get
	serialized. 

	* Proxiable
	Remove all support for transparent remote Proxy object.  Too
	complicated, too fragile, and far too easy to abuse.

2000-02-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ProxiableSet
	removed - anyone can use UniqueObjectSet instead.

	* UniqueObjectSet
	Generalize ProxiableSet, since Proxiable is going away.

2000-02-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* society
	Remove voyager support.  Broken and buggy and nobody seems
	interested in fixing it.

2000-02-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* scalability, management
	moved packages to tools module.

	* Copyrights
	Updated copyright comments as appropriate.  Any files which have
	< copyright > < /copyright > pairs (without the extra spaces) can
	be updated mechanically in the future.

	* various
	Removed dead code.

	* ClusterIdentifier
	moved from alp to alp.cluster.

	* GenericStateModel*, StateModelException
	moved from alp to alp.util.

	* mil.darpa.log.alp
	Merged m.d.l.a classes into alp.* to prepare for breaking them
	back out into domain packages.  Exceptions:  merged
	m.d.l.a.utilities into alp.util, m.d.l.a.data into alp.ldm.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessageImpl Remove try-catch around deserialization of
	DirectiveMessage. Yes, I know I already did that, but this one is
	in readExternal.

	* DatabasePersistence
	Add logging output to files.

2000-02-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ALPObject, QoSO, lots-of-others
	Removed ALPObject and QoSO.  Worse than useless: the isValid
	methods look like they should be useful, but the implementations
	are usually wrong and occasionally NPE.

	* AggregationImpl, CompositionImpl
	Fix an infinite recursion in auto-propagate rescind.  Several
	synchronization fixes should close some potential bogons. Don't
	copy collections so gratuitously.

2000-02-16  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DirectiveMessageImpl
	Remove try-catch around deserialization of the directives. Allow
	the exception to propagate so that the entire DirectiveMessage is
	abandoned instead of being processed with the missing directives.

	* RescindLP
	Disable short-circuiting of rescinds of tasks allocated to
	self. Doing so allows rescinds to get ahead of allocates such that
	rescind finds nothing to rescind and, later, the supposedly
	rescinded task appears.

	* Persistence
	Embed debugging statements in conditionals to reduce consing when
	not debugging.
	Replace references to unpublished plan elements with null instead
	of throwing an exception. This may help with the Aggregator
	problem.

	* Preposition intern all the constants.

	* MessageManager given separate thread for sending ACKs so that
	ACK transmission can held off during epoch advancement. Remove
	epoch numbering.

2000-02-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter, *Plugin
	All plugin classes can now select their threading model at load
	time.  The whole API is in PluginAdapter and all the basic
	subclasses have be greatly simplified to take advantage by
	choosing whichever threading model they wish.  Provisions are made 
	to allow a plugin to implement its own threading model, but a
	pretty good range is supplied (NONE, ONESHOT, SINGLE, SHARED).
	All defaults are consistent - no source changes (or recompiles!)
	are required.  The old base classes will probably be deprecated
	for ALP 6.0 just to re-simplify the choice of base class.  
	Also, the SINGLE threading model has new options to lower the
	priority and/or stop the explicit post-cycle() yield.

2000-02-11  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Expose the database connection through the ClusterServersPlugin
	API so plugins can use the same database transaction as
	persistence.

	* Add database version of persistence storing deltas in database
	table "long raw" column.

2000-02-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Remove support for -Dalp.traceAssets.

2000-02-10  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Add StringUtility.appendArray(StringBuffer buf, Object[] array)
	to append the string representation of an array to a StringBuffer.

	* Add StringUtility.arrayToString(Object[]) to form a string
	representation of an array of the form "[<item>,<item>,...]" where
	each <item> is the toString() value of the objects in the array.

	* Reinstate sequence number transport in messages. This is
	essential for correct operation of persistence. Also remove
	epochid and contents. These are not being used.

	* Change DirectiveMessage to hold an array of directives instead
	of just one. Fill one directive message for each destination with
	the directives that result from all the transactions handled by
	the logplan in one cycle. This insures that the effect of the
	directives will enter the destination logplan in a single
	transaction. Plugins can take advantage of this by knowing that
	every change made by one plugin in one transaction will appear in
	one transaction of another plugin even if the second plugin is in
	another cluster.

2000-02-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskScoreTable, ExpansionImpl
	Re-implement TaskScoreTable as a simplified closed HashTable. 
	There's a terrible inefficiency somewhere in here: the
	TaskScoreTable is recreated each time something changes, and then
	the expansion's SubTaskResult list is *also* recreated each time
	it is asked for.  We need to re-examine the whole partial-results
	logic.
	
2000-02-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PingNameServer
	A utility for testing NameServer functionality.

2000-02-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Node
	Disable Application server support for now.
	Add VM and OS information on startup.  Make Cluster loading
	process nicer.

2000-02-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMI*, Communications, etc
	Cut over to a full-RMI system.  It should be pretty easy now that
	it is properly generalized, to make the Voyager stuff work again.
	Updates to management console to work with the new mechanism are
	still in progress.  Otherwise, everything else is functional.
	
	* NameServer, RMINameServer, et.al.
	Extended NameServer api to extend Java Collections Map api.  Added 
	functionality to support a directory structure on top of
	traditional Map interface.

2000-02-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Parameters
	ALP parameter utility for doing various sorts of string
	substitution based on the calling environment.

2000-01-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TriggerManagerPlugin
	Adjust logic slightly. make it a fat plugin. 
	Add alp.trigger.verbosity=0.  Set =2 to print progress notes.  
	Add alp.trigger.minWait=1000 to set minimum wait pause time.

	* PeriodicAlarm, Timer
	Add support for non-terminating, periodic alarms.
	Also, timer always waits at least 0.1 seconds between alarms to
	make sure that it doesn't run all out.  This is particularly
	important since otherwise periodic alarms can be written to cause
	severe damage.

	* RMINameserver, RMIMessageTransport
	Add alp.nameserver.verbosity parameter.  If 0 (default),
	nameservice reports are very quiet. if 1, stackdumps on errors.
	If 2, progress reports and stack dumps.

2000-01-28  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* UID
	Adjust uid comparison a bit.  Shouldn't be functionally different
	but is probably slightly faster.

	* PlanElementImpl
	wire in reality plan.  Update beaninfo here and for directive to
	not publish plan.

	* Node
	First create all the clusters, then populate them with plugins.
	Prevents needing to queue messages for forward-referenced clusters 
	in the same node.

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Check earlier in the chain for intra-node delivery options to
	avoid incurring the inQ/outQ overhead.

	* RoleScheduleImpl
	Reuse PEBinaryPredicate instance.  Optimize predicates so as not
	to defeat memoization of aspect value accessors.
	
	* PEBinaryPredicate
	make just one instance to be reused, for instance by
	RoleScheduleImpl. Also optimize.		

	* TaskImpl
	Make UID non-transient: we're spending too much time recomputing
	'em.

	* DirectiveImpl
	Wire in RealityPlan to save a cell and some serialization cost.

	* PlanImpl, ClusterObjectFactory
	Make realityPlan a static.

	* ClusterImpl
	Turn off the showProgress newline generation, as it doesn't help
	readability and adds a moderately contended lock.

	* ReceiveNotificationLP, NotificationLP
	send intra-cluster notifications via direct-call rather than
	actually creating a notification and a directive message and then
	sending it through the message transport.  This should be a big
	improvement for busy multi-level clusters - e.g. those with
	several cooperating plugins.

	* Verb
	Adjust equals methods: 
	equals(String) checks for == before equals and no longer interns
	the argument to optimize the most common case.
	equals(Object) checks for == and includes string equality for
	consistency. 

2000-01-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Extend fallback mode timeouts for large, slow societies.

	* ClusterObjectFactoryImpl
	Stop registering proxiables.  Nobody should care, anyway.

	* LaborScheduleImpl
	Partial rewrite.  Keeps combined schedule around instead of
	recomputing each time it is needed. Some improvements in
	computation of combined schedule. Thunk operations work on
	combined schedule instead of bogus set.

	* QuantityScheduleElement
	SumQuantities utility Thunk.

	* ScheduleUtilities
	Minor optimizations and a bunch of Thunk-based utility methods.

	* Thunk
	Add some utility thunk classes: Counter and Collector


	* ScheduleUtilities
	Move to alp.ldm.plan from alp.ldm.plan, leaving a
	deprecated shell behind.

2000-01-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RMIMessageTransport
	Detect old Admin node or multiple message clients with the same
	name. Add alp.message.decacheFailureLimit parameter, show
	exceptions on transport errors while tracing is turned on,
	printing them to log (.cml) files.		

2000-01-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Equals for assets is defined as being exactly the same class and
	having equals TypeIdentification and ItemIdentification codes. 
	
	* AggregateAssetAdapter
	Equals for aggregate assets is defined as having the same quantity
	of the same (equals) asset.  TID and IID are ignored.
	
	* MessageTransport, Citizen
	Generalize the MessageTransport selection code.  Simplest option
	is to set system property alp.message.transport to the short name
	of the transport.  Example:
		-Dalp.message.transport=RMI
	Currently valid values are "RMI" (the default), "Voyager" and "Pipe".
	alp.message.transportClass property still works and overrides the above.

	* Citizen
	Make RMI the default transport/nameserver.

	* RMINameServer
	add system property alp.nameserver.verbose=false.  Iff true, will
	report non-fatal namespace exceptions, otherwise will print "!" to 
	err each time.

2000-01-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	Add -Dalp.traceAssets=true flag to enable reporting of Asset
	prototype transfers.

	* AssetWriter
	Change some casting so that failed prototype transfer wont cause
	class cast exceptions.

2000-01-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.society.rmi.*
	Slightly hacked first cut at an RMI-based MessageTransport and
	NameServer.  Still requires the voyager-based FdsRegistry code for 
	compatibility with PSPs, management console, etc.  Turned on with 
	-Dalp.message.transportClass=alp.society.rmi.RMIMessageTransport

2000-01-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Make fallbackCount default to 10 (>50 seconds). 
	Add decacheFailureLimit parameter - simply retries sends this many 
	times (forever if 0) before forcing another namespace lookup.
	DestinationQueues will now discover local clients instead of
	relying on voyager for forward-referenced (local) destinations.

	* FdsRegistry
	Change MulticastAddress lookup to not take a prefix to reduce
	String consing.

	* DirectiveMessage, et.al.
	Make DirectiveMessages faster to serialize.

	* ClusterIdentifier, MessageAddress
	Make lighter-weight and fast to serialize.

	* alp.util.FastString
	String wrapper class for fast (CPU-wise) serialization of strings.
	You can turn off use of this with -Dalp.message.useFastString=false.

2000-01-07  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* RoleSchedule, et.al.
	Maintain RoleSchedule at publish boundaries rather than at
	allocation and LP time. 

	* MessageTransport, PipedMessageTransport
	Performance improvements for debugging.  Also make the default for 
	alwaysSerialize actually not serialize loopback messages
	(e.g. cluster to itself).  This is more like what
	VoyagerMessageTransport does, though it contradicts
	"alwaysSerialize".  Use alp.message.useLocalDelivery=false to
	restore to the previous behavior.  Also implements a deadletter
	box for messages directed to clusters which do not yet exist -
	this box is traversed whenever a new cluster is added so that
	forward references work without forever looping on clusters which
	will never exist.

	* ReceiveNotificationLP
	More useful debug message when we get an unhandle-able notification.

	* TaskProxyImpl
	Dump stack whenever some loser dereferences a taskProxy.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Enter a slow-retry fallback mode after 5 consecutive message
	failures.  See javadoc for more info.

2000-01-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.StringKey, alp.cluster.*Set
	Use StringKey to avoid recomputing string hashCodes bazillions of times.

	* SharedPluginManager
	Better scheduler: the more recently a plugin ran, the lower it's
	priority in the queue.

	* Various
	Initialize HashMaps to non-default, reasonable, prime sizes.

	* UID, MessageAddress
	Cache the hashcode, so as not to recompute based on the string
	each lookup.

	* AllocationResult
	Include aux queries in isEquals test.  TOPS request.

	* TaskImpl
	Indicate how many auxqueries present during tostring.  Any more
	information is up to the caller.  TOPS request.

	* RoleScheduleImpl
	Use correct predicates throughout, based on those in
	SchedulePredicate.  More documentation, cleanup. SRA request.

	* SchedulePredicate
	Fix some end-time checks, document. SRA request.

1999-12-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AspectValue
	Add equals(Object) and hashCode methods.

1999-12-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Faster and more fair incoming message queuing.

	* TaskImpl, ClusterMessageImpl
	More useful toString methods

	* FdsRegistry
	Reduce the time spent in synchronized code when the code is going
	to have to timeout/fail.

1999-12-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AspectValue
	catch setting the value to NaN.

1999-12-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PlanElement, et.al.
	Make plan elements self-describing beans, not exposing the
	conflict methods.

	* Schedule, et.al.
	Update docs and implementations to reflect closed-start/open-end
	of scheduleElement time span definition.

1999-12-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ScalabilityManager
	resolve some slightly ambiguous method references.
	
	* ReceiveNotificationLP, ExpansionImpl, TaskScoreTable
	Much faster maintenance of expansion subtask results.  Includes
	api additions to supporting objects.

	* Verb, UID, PrepositionalPhraseImpl, TaskImpl
	Optimize critical equality tests with == when appropriate.
	
	* RescindLP
	Disable conflict flagging code - see yesterday's log below for
	info.

1999-11-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SimplifiedFatPlugin
	New plugin base class like SimplifiedPlugin except has a thread of 
	its own.

	* ClusterImpl, AllocationImpl, AssetTransferImpl
	Disconnected RoleScheduleConflictLP and have accessors throw
	exceptions if/when called.  Computation of the Conflicts was a
	cpu hog, and since nobody actually uses the information...

	* Oplan, et.al.
	Oplan.clone() now does a deep copy of the components, so that we
	don't share detailed state within a node (and miss change
	reports). should fix a bug noticed by TASC.

	* ClusterImpl
	Property alp.cluster.trafficPeriod, defaulting to 80, indicates
	how many traffic characters to print to stdout before adding a
	newline.  If <= 0, no newlines will be printed.

1999-11-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SingleThreadedPlugin, SharedPluginManager
	name Threads.

	* ClusterImpl
	print \n after every 10 status chars.

	* Schedule, ScheduleImpl
	Accessor for Thunk application.

	* Thunk, Collectors
	Abstract and cheap iteration over set-like objects.

	* Envelope
	avoid consing iterators in inner loop of transaction opens.  Small 
	but significant overhead because these points are exercised so
	often. Small additional gains could be had by using a simpler
	implementation of List - for instance one that doesn't do bounds
	checking on each get(int) or one that exposes the internal array
	on demand.

	* Asset
	Increase efficiency of setPropertyGroup(), which used some
	expensive and uncached introspection to do its thing.  Now uses
	less expensive introspection and caches its results in a static.
	Requires the PropertyGroup changes below.  Also removed some old
	debugging code and supplied reasonable initial sizes for
	hashset/hashmaps.

	* PropertyGroup, *PG, PGWriter
	add getters so that we can avoid introspecting to find the
	asset.setFoo method names in Asset.

1999-11-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* management
	Reduce Date and string consing.

	* PGWriter
	Consistency on statics in generated interface code.

	* Subscriber
	reduce consing of empty iterators.

	
1999-11-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	Minor cleanup. Added alp.cluster.showTraffic=false to turn off the 
	message sent/received characters (+/-).		

	* TriggerManagerPlugin
	Rewrite to clean up the control flow.  Simpler, uses the below
	changes to be smarter about redundant alarms and proper time to
	sleep. Never goes to sleep for less than 1sec, though it can still 
	be wake()ed by logplan changes.

	* PluginAdapter.PluginAlarm
	Added a toString() method to PluginAlarm so that the verbose modde 
	of Timer is actually slightly useful.

	* Alarm, PluginAdapter, Timer, ScenarioTimer
	Added Alarm.cancel() method.

	* TriggerTimeBasedMonitor
	Use system time consistently.  Add getRemainingTime method to use
	in deciding how long to wait.

	* Trigger
	Move call to IndicateRan to end of execute, so that we time-based
	triggers that take a while to execute don't end up running
	constantly. 

	* PluginAdapter
	New sanity checks on wake* calls.  Complains when the wake times
	requested are already past.

	* Timer
	Add some debugging options:
		alp.timer=quiet		no output
		alp.timer=visible	asterix on each alarm
		alp.timer=verbose	timer and alarm printed each alarm
	quiet is the current default.  A current concern is that alarms
	are being set to go off very rapidly or lots of alarms set to go
	off in the past.  If these turn out to be happening, we'll have to
	implement a minimum wait time.
	

1999-11-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ForcePackage
	update .equals() to not NPE on empty ForcePackageID.

	* AllocationResult
	Attempt to fix significant redundant cloning of number arrays -
	mostly reduced time and temporary-object consing.  Really needs a
	full rewrite with an eye towards efficiency AND safety.

	* PreferenceChangeLP, TaskImpl
	Better version of hack to fix comodification errors in
	PreferenceChangeLP. 

1999-11-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClusterImpl
	PluginLoader semantics are too complicated for people in crunch
	mode.  Default is now to use *only* classpath to load classes.
	-Dalp.cluster.pluginloader=true will turn the plugin loader back
	on. 

	* ReceiveTransferableLP
	Reconcile incoming Oplans with the logplan, add/remove/change
	subordinate objects (OplanContributors) as needed.

	* Oplan, et.al.
	Make ForcePackage, OrgRelation and OrgActivity subordinate object
	to Oplan. Various Oplan objects now support equals()

	* Translations
	utility class for translating between different java object holder 
	implementations.  E.g. Enumeration to Collection, etc.

1999-11-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetSkeletonBase
	Break out static code from AssetSkeleton for several reasons:
		a. PGWriter no longer has to write it.
		b. simplify modifying the static stuff.
	Taking advantage of the latter point, it now does lazy
	otherProperties construction, now uses an ArrayList instead of a
	Vector, and it smarter about sets, etc.  Result is lower memory
	load, may be slightly faster too.  Basis for correcting some
	long-standing awkwardnesses - stay tuned.

	* LdmFactory, ClusterObjectFactoryImpl, etc
	LDMFactory and related classes now use the plugin classloader to
	find classes at runtime instead of Class.forName.  This should
	allow creation of policy objects, and non-standard assets and pgs 
	from plugins loaded with the plugin classloader, e.g. from plugins 
	not in classpath.	

1999-11-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.util.CircularQueue
	New utility collection which implements an efficient circular
	queue of objects.  Used in MessageTransport et al as a much
	lighter-weight message-passing object insulating the various
	threads from each other.  Replaces JGL queue and Collection
	LinkedList uses.  Reduces consing of short-lived objects since
	both old cases allocate element holders, whereas CircularQueue
	just uses an array of Object as backing store.  See javadoc for
	more details.

	* PGs
	Removed confusing empty PGs: OrganizationPropertyGroups,
	OrganizationTypePropertyGroups, MilitaryOrganizationPG,
	NonMilitaryFederalOrganizationPG, StateAndLocalOrganizationPG,
	CommercialOrganizationPG, ForeignMilitaryOrganizationPG,
	ForeignGovernmentalOrganizationPG.  Changed MilitaryOrganization
	asset to have a default slot of MilitaryOrgPG rather than the (now
	removed) MilitaryOrganizationPG.

1999-11-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CapacityScheduleElement
	New type of ScheduleElement with a Capacity as the stored value
	per SE.

	* ProxyQueryTable
	Moved proxy query handler to new file from clusterImpl,
	cleaned/rewrote, removed lots of old/broken stuff. Also fixed a
	bug which prevented proxy queries from actually working at all.

1999-11-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SchedulePredicate
	Change to use longs instead of Dates.

	* TriggerManagerPlugin
	set minimum interval for timer-based triggers to 1000ms.

	* TaskImpl, ScheduleElement
	Make smaller in-memory and serialization footprints.
	ScheduleElement ordering should be faster, too.

	* ObjectInputStreamWithContext
	use resolveObject to support re-uniquing object after
	serialization.  Intern short strings on deserialization, also
	"intern" Service, Role, Verb and CIDs.

1999-11-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OPlan various
	Fix beaninfo for several classes which declared a
	PropertyDescriptor array larger than the set of properties
	actually filled in.

	* PipedMessageTransport
	implement an optional byte counter for the pipe to track the sizes
	of messages.

1999-11-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ArgTable (Node)
	Allow simplified arguments to Node.  Assume that a
	non-dash-prefixed argument is the Node name ("Foo" is like "-n
	Foo").  Also, a name of "admin" or "Administrator" sets the
	defaults to be what the node scripts have been setting.
	Should be completely backward-compatible.

	* Preposition
	add MAINTAINING

	* LaborScheduleImpl, ScheduleImpl
	Rearrange synchronization to allow LSI schedules to be modified.
	Also reduces copy operations.

	* *PG
	Fix beaninfo indexed collection getters to handle unset (null)
	collections without generating invocation errors.

1999-11-08  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ContainPG
	Added IsPrepositioned boolean slot.  Used to specify that a cargo
	vehicle is designated as holding prepo.  This implies that it will
	be full of prepo cargo at the start of an operation.

	* Asset, etc
	Changed serialization of Asset prototypes.  Here's the new
	algorithm:
	If Cluster A is sending Asset Q with Prototype P to Cluster B:

	In A (serialization), while encoding Q, if P has already been sent
	to B, send only the TypeIdentification (TID) of P, else send the
	whole object, noting first that we've sent it at least once to
	B. Send only null if P is null.    
	
	In B (deserialization), while decoding Q, if P is sent as a TID,
	look up the TID in B's LDM.  If we fail, construct P as a plain
	Asset, expose to local PropertyProviders, and cache P, using the
	new P instance as Q's prototype.  If P is sent as an asset, check
	B's LDM.  If found, drop the serialized P on the floor and use the 
	local prototype, otherwise expose the prototype to the local B
	PropertyProviders, cache it and continue.

	This should be stable with persistence, resulting only in
	redundant sends of the prototypes by A to B after A is
	reconstructed. 

	* Container
	add ScheduledContentPG to Container (TOPS reqest)
	
	* Package
	New Asset class. Like Container, but for temporary items like
	pallets, et al.


1999-11-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	If while deserializing there is no prototype provider in the
	current cluster for the instance's prototype asset, we'll create
	one, expose it to propertyproviders and cache it for later.

	* PluginAdapter
	Use RealTime alarms for RealTime variations of wake*.  The
	previous wake* methods are still scenario time.  Timer needs for
	throttling computation, batching, etc, should be better served by
	the RealTime methods.

	All wake* methods now return the alarm instance actually set.
	This allows callers to use Alarm.hasExpired() to test to see if
	that particular alarm has rung, regardless of if the they missed
	the wake or not.

	* Alarm
	Added hasExpired() method.

	* Timer, ScenarioTimer
	Split Timer into two classes, one for realtime, the other for 
	scenario time.

	* ClusterImpl, ClusterServesPlugin
	Expose RealTime timers to plugins (and implement them).

	* FDSRegistry
	Pass more lookup exceptions through to caller so that the caller
	can determine the best course of action.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Respond loudly to serious lookup problems (e.g. host not found).
	Also, more isLogging support for destination-queues.

1999-11-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* measures.def
	Changed common unit of Duration to hours and Mass to short_tons.
	SRA request.

	* PGs
	Another attempt to get the beaninfo for collection types correct.
	It is unfortunate that java doesn't allow any form of casting from
	Object[] to Foo[].

1999-11-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginLoader
	Replaced PluginClassLoader with PluginLoader.  PIL is a single
	facility which uses URLClassLoader to extend the directories used
	to load plugin classes to .../lib/*, .../plugins/* and
	.../<product>/lib/* where "*" is any *.{jar,zip,plugin}.  This
	implementation doesn't actually use a security manager, but
	does verify loaded plugin class certificates.  See
	doc/details/Security.txt for further information.  Does not
	restrict plugins from referencing each other.

	* KeyRing
	Move keystore functionality from SignedMessageSecurityManager to
	KeyRing to be used by multiple places.  A side effect is that the
	system properties used to control have changed slightly.
	doc/details/Security.txt has further information.
	

1999-10-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Be a little louder when Voyager times out or otherwise fails to
	deliver a message.

	* FdsRegistry
	Rework of threading and synchronization.  Several potential
	deadlocks removed.  Much lower lock contention, particularly for
	PSP use which can stress the registry's reentrant properties.
	Many fewer network operations while holding locks.  No longer have 
	synchronized methods - instead have two guard locks to separate
	the two major sync usage bodies.  Intended functionality should be 
	unchanged - just more stable and perhaps slightly faster. Old
	version is retained (temporarily) in FdsRegistry.old.

1999-10-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp/ldm/assets/(various)
	Merged in Tops deltas.  Mostly changes to TransportationNetwork
	assets and PGs.

	* AssetWriter
	Removed redundant beaninfo slots, since we chain upwards to get
	the info.  Doesn't actually change visible behavior, since bean
	introspector eliminates duplicates.

	* PositionImpl et al
	fixed clone methods to work without lat/lon defined.  No need to
	construct new lat/lon objects since they are immutable.

1999-10-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Skill
	added parser-based constructors which take a string of
	"/"-separated values.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Fixed multicast messages for destination queues.
	Also wait 5 seconds instead of 5ms before recycling an idle
	message delivery queue

	Also cleaned house - removed some dead code, updated
	documentation, adjusted system property use.
	
	* SharedPluginManager
	Try and catch errors.  Many JITs will remain trashed, however, so
	you'll have to run interpreted if you get this.

1999-10-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* CSSCapability
	Added CSSCapability(String) constructor.  In conjunction with the
	below should allow .ini file parsers to build CSSCapability
	objects.  See javadoc for examples and more info.
 	
	Added equals and hashcode.

	* alp.ldm.measure
	Added Count back in (was commented out for some reason).  Also
	made sure that the default unit for all measures (index 0) is
	the metric base unit wherever possible.
	
	String constructors for measures now can take both things like:
	"123 grams" and "123.0grams".

	Added Test class as a point test.

	new measure.getCommonUnit() returns a commonly-used unit.
	generally, the unit returned is the one most often used by
	military logistics planners for transportation purposes.

	new measure.getUnitName(int) returns the name of the unit
	specified.

	Added equals and hashCode to Capacity.

	Added Capacity(String) constructor which uses reflection to parse
	the argument.

	Made "units" the default unit for Count, keeping eaches as an
	alias.

	Extended point test to ping Capacity parser.
	
1999-10-04  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ClaimableImpl
	Rewritten to use PrivilegedClaimant instead of special cases.
	Adjusted to make sure that all claims warnings really are warnings 
	rather than enforced reports.
	Added system property alp.cluster.claim.isLoud.  Only prints stack 
	traces when set to true, otherwise will be quieter and remind the
	user about isLoud on the first report.

	* PrivilegedClaimant
	New Class generalizes the privileged access to claimable objects
	that were previously only available to Assessors and core internal
	objects (e.g. LogPlan).  Read the javadoc before using it!


	* alp.test.IntrospectionTest
	Test fixture for beans introspection of any class.

	* Role
	BeanInfo added.

	* alp.ldm.asset.*
	New beans introspection mechanism.  Each asset and PG supplies
	beaninfo directly instead of relying on extra BeanInfo classes.
	PG Collections are now supported and lockedPGs are better
	supported with simpler special-casing.  This should be 100%
	backward compatible, possibly modulo client handling of new
	facilities.  Do not compile this set on top of an existing class
	hierarchy - many classes (BeanInfo) are no longer generated, so
	you'll have problems if you mix old .classes with new code.

1999-10-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* FdsRegistry
	Quiet debug messages, turn off explicit GC as a major runtime
	lose, especially for demos.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	Rewrite Multicast delivery to take advantage of
	QueuedMessageDelivery. Also somewhat cleaner logic flow.

	* FdsRegistry
	Repair multicast message target lookup so that time propagation
	works again.

	* MilitaryOrgPG
	added home_location slot as a quicker access to org's geoloc.

	* PGBeanInfo
	Changed PGWriter to write better BeanInfo defs:
	1. Fixed bug with method-like properties by no-longer having
	beaninfo representations for those "slots".
	2. Added support of Collection-typed slots as IndexedProperties.

1999-09-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* alp.ldm.asset.CSSCapabilityPG
	Has a list of CSSCapability objects.

	* alp.ldm.plan.CSSCapability
	Has a capability "type" like "MOS/43B" or "FuelTransport" and a
	Capacity like "88 hours per day" or "1000 gallons per minute".
	
	* alp.ldm.measure.Capacity
	New Measure class has a scalar numerator and a duration
	denominator. Can also support "instantaneous" Capacity with
	unspecified duration.  CSS support.

	* alp.ldm.measure.Scalar
	New Measure class is a superclass of various scalar measures
	like Mass, Volume, Distance and Duration.  Prerequisite for CSS
	support.
	
	* alp.ldm.measure.Count
	Resurrected count for CSS support.

	* SignedMessageSecurityManager
	Implemented a real MSM (loosely) based on BBN Columbia's IA
	wizards.  Signs messages and depends on local (config)
	availability of public keys.  See doc/details for the whole story
	with all the details of the demo implementation.

1999-09-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MessageSecurityManager
	Initial interfaces for MSM, along with a SecureMessage ifc and
	vacuous impls in DummyMessageSecurityManager.

1999-09-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PluginClassLoader
	Quiet warning (PLUGIN directory missing) since nobody, including
	alpine, is building "correct" plugins. Also make it work properly
	under windows, since zip entries do not get their names translated 
	between '/' and '\\'.  sigh.

	* alp.util.Sortings
	Extensions to Collection.sort include non-destructive sorting,
	sorting of any Collection type, and use of element keys
	(Mapping). Example: you can get a copy of a list of people sorted
	by name with something like:
		Collection byName = Sortings.sort(people, alphabeticCompare, mapName);
	where alphabeticCompare is a comparator and mapName is a Mapping
	which returns the name of a person.  The result will be a new
	list containing the people of the original list, sorted by name.
	
1999-09-24  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* assets
	More adjustment of ERQ support (as negotiated with ICIS).
	yesterdays support dumped:
	  - removed VolumetricStorageTank, FuelTank
	  - changed VolumetricERQPG to VolumetricStockagePG
	current support:
	- new asset classes:
	  - Inventory isa Asset, hasa ScheduledContentPG
	  - VolumetricInventory isa Inventory, hasa VolumetricStockagePG
	- new VolumetricStockagePG
	  - has reorder_level, min_reorder_volume and unobtainable volumes
	It would be nice if we had a Quantity/Quantized measure so that
	we could support multiple measures of stockage parameters with one
	Inventory Asset and one StockagePG.  Maybe next year.

	* Skill
	Added a bunch of Predicates selecting for various skill types.
	see additional notes in today's ChangeLog entries below.

	* Person
	Simplified Person hierarchy:
	- only two classes of Person, all others removed.
	  - Person: has PersonPG
	  - MilitaryPerson: has MilitaryPersonPG and AssignmentPG
	- only two classeses of Person PGs, all others removed.
	  - PersonPG: replaces PersonIDPG, adds a Collection of Skills
	  - MilitaryPersonPG: unchanged.
	Note: the alp.util.Filters utility class will be helpful for
	anyone who wants to search the skills set for particular skill
	codes, types, etc.  For example, to find a Person's MOS:
		Collection skills = person.getPersonPG().getSkills();
		Skill mos = Filters.findElement(skills, Skill.mosP);
	
	* Skill
	New generic representation of personal Skills used by PersonPG.
	Most skills are represented by the Skill class: e.g. the MOS 11B
	might be constructed as:
		new Skill("MOS","11B","Infantryman");  // prints as "MOS/11B"
	Also an extension of Skill is AircrewSkill:
		new AircrewSkill("C-17", "Pilot", "AirRefueling", "A1", true);
	(which prints as "Aircrew/Pilot").
	Skill defines a bunch of Predicates which test for various common
	skill types (e.g. MOS).
	
1999-09-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* assets
	remove "old=" lines from PG defs.
	Support for ERQ (requested by ICIS).
	- new assets: 
	  - VolumetricStorageTank which is a major end item similar
	  to a container except it stores liquids and has a
	  VolumetricERQPG. 
	  - FuelTank which is a vacuous subclass of the above.
	- new PG:
	  - VolumetricERQPG which represents EconomicReorderQuantity.
	
	* Measures
	New constructors:
	- Measure(double, int) is like newMeasure(double, int).
	- Measure(String) takes strings like "number unit" where number is 
	any kind of parsable double representation and unit is a valid
	(full) unit name - any mix of case is accepted.  E.g. "47.3 pounds"		

	* Composition
	Require that the combinedTask be an MP task at compile time.

	* alp.util
	Various classes that should have been part of the JDK Collections
	framework:
	- Predicate:  Similar to the JGL UnaryPredicate.
	- Filters:  Predicate-based subsetting of Collections.
	- Mapping:  Predicate-like functional object transformer.
	- Mappings:  Mapping-based Collection transformation.

1999-09-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* TaskProxyImpl
	removed deprecated getID().  use getKey().

	* TaskImpl
	removed deprecated getID().  use getKey().
	
	* ConfigFileFinder
	removed deprecated locate(String).  Use an open method.

	* PluginAdapter
	removed deprecated getComponent().  Use getCluster().
	removed deprecated wake(long).  Use wakeAfter(long).

	* EssentialPlugin
	removed deprecated withSubscriptionLock().  Use open/closeTransaction().

	* ClusterObjectFactory
	removed deprecated createAssetTransfer w/out Role argument.  Use
	method with Role argument.
	removed deprecated createAllocation w/out Role argument.  Use
	method with Role argument.
	deprecated getVerb(String). Use Verb constructor.

	* OrganizationAdapter
	removed deprecated getPredictor.  Use getClusterPG().getPredictor()
	removed deprecated setPredictor.  Use getClusterPG().setPredictor()
	
	* Asset
	removed deprecated removeATRoleSchedule().  Use getRoleSchedule().removeATRoleSchedule()  

1999-09-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* DefaultPrototypeProviderPlugin
	disable it by not loading by default.  If someone needs it, it
	can still be loaded in cluster config files.

	* PGWriter
	Added getFooHandler accessors so that one could tell if there is
	a value handler installed without requiring a try/catch.  Also
	made it all compilable with javac.  Javac bug reported to Javasoft.

1999-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset*BeanInfo
	New generated BeanInfo classes parallel the asset tree and
	recursively find all the properties.  Added some BeanInfo classes
	for non-generated adapter and special asset classes.

	* AssetConsumptionRatePG
	New PG with computed slot for adding Consumption rates to assets.
  	Added to asset tree as a required PG at ClassVIIMajorEndItem.
	(requested by ICIS) 

	* NewPrepositionalPhrase.setIndirectObject(Object)
	method added for most-general case. (requested by TOPS)

1999-09-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetConsumptionRate
	Corrected package.  Was alp.ldm.asset, now alp.ldm.plan.

1999-09-09  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* ConfigFileFinder
	Strongly deprecate locate() method which finds a File, add a new
	method open() which returns an InputStream.  New functionality
	(open) does the same old thing with raw (relative) file names by
	default, but can also retrieve files using a variety of other
	methods: ftp, http and file.  When the property alp.config.server
	is set with node's -cs argument, it should be a prefix to a
	configuration server directory
	(e.g. "http://config.alp.org/"). when the property alp.config is 
	set with node's -config argument, it is appended to the cs url
	(e.g. "minitestconfig").  
	See alp/doc/details/ConfigurationServer.txt for details.
	

	* alpine.society.*
	Support for ConfigurationServer. Added -cs option to set the
	configuration server URL. Added -ns option to set the name server
	string, in place of using alpreg.ini.
 	
	
	

1999-09-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Subscriptions
	Subscription communication is now keyed solely on subscription
	instance, rather than predicate.  This eliminated ambiguity in
	cases where there are multiple subscriptions with the same
	predicate. the subscribe(UnaryPredicate) pattern is now removed
	completely.

	* VoyagerMessageTransport
	All Messages with the same destination are queued together.  Each
	queue is emptied by its' own thread with is started on demand and
	stopped when idle for long enough.  Should reduce maximum thread
	load in general, and result in much lower overall thread-system
	contention. Also fewer simulateous connection attempts per
	cluster, since multiple messages to X from Y will be delivered
	serially instead of attempting it all at the same time.

	* asset.*
	Machine-generate BeanInfo classes for Assets.

	* AssetConsumptionRate
	FCR-like interface.  Still needs a PG to hook everything up.

1999-08-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Timer
	Timer had used TreeSet to keep the alarms in the right
	order. Unfortunately, TreeSet assumes that equal ordering == equal 
	objects (seems pretty bogus to me).  This meant that you couldn't
	have two different alarms set to go off at the same time.  Now we
	use arrayList and a custom insert to keep the order right.  We
	still use a comparator so when sun fixes things, we can go back to 
	a better implementation.

1999-08-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LogicProvider et al
	Eliminate test() method as requiring redundant processing - just
	call execute() and let it decide if it can handle it or not.
	Simplified API of helper functions by moving them to
	EnvelopeTuple. Did some general cleanup of LPs while porting them
	to new api.

	* task.getPlanElement
	Maintain task.getPlanElement at publish* boundaries. Had been
	doing adds at PE construction time and removes at (un)claim time.
	
	* LogicProvider
	Use LdmFactory instead of ClusterObjectFactory.

	* Asset*
	Separate the concepts of copying an asset ("I have a new truck
	just like this other one except, of course, with a different VIN
	and bumper number") and subset-cloning an asset ("This is a
	representation of this same asset with only the subset of its
	capabilities I allow to to use").  The former is available via
	LdmFactory.copyInstance(Asset) and the latter via
	LdmFactory.cloneInstance(Asset).  See documentation for details.
	Asset.copy() should no longer be used.

1999-08-19  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetTransfer
	Change an AssetTransfer and an update message is sent, which can
	update the available schedule and a handful of asset properties:
	ClusterPG, OrganizationPG, AssignedPG.  This allows serving
	cluster, predictor, and available roles to be updated as needed.
	Beware, though of trying to use predictors to represent dynamic
	state - you'll just flood the society with useless messages.

	* Asset/PGWriter
	Asset.set*PG now all take simply PropertyGroup as an argument.
	Should greatly simplify reflective data plugins.  Old "NewFooPG"
	requirement was leftover from an ancient requirement.

1999-08-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* OrganizationAdapter
	Use ClusterPG as real storage for ClusterID and Predictor.

1999-08-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM
	Major Rework of Properties for OpenSource release.
	In general:
	 Property and Capability suffixes changed to "PG".
	 Organization asset hierarchy simplified.
	 Removed some deadwood.
	
	* PGWriter
 	(was PropertyWriter) produces a perl script (updateLDM.pl)
	to convert between old and new propertygroups and a
	Properties.index which has an alphabetically-sorted list of
	property groups with documentation and slots along with a 
	permuted index of property slots.
	updateLDM.pl and Properties.index should be copied to the
	alp/doc/ReleaseNotes tree prior to each release.

	* properties.def
	Added TOPS-requested property changes, as modified by the above
	changes. 
	
1999-08-12  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM
	Removed lots of deprecated and stale code, including old OPlan
	implementation.
	
	* measures
	Lots of minor changes.  New Energy class, better Power definition.
	removed Count.

	* Verb
	alp.ldm.plan.Verb is now a real class

	* Role
	Expanded implementation

	* MOS
	New MOS object - patterned on Verb

1999-08-02  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* LDM.getPrototype
	Add an optional second argument, an Asset class hint as to what
	type of Asset you are asking for.  If specified, any returned
	Asset should be instanceof the specified class - that is, an
	instance of that Asset class or a Subclass.  If not specified,
	PropertyProviders must still check and see if they know about the
	specified typeid.

	* PrototypeProvider
	changed getPrototype to take a required second argument - the
	Asset Class being looked for.  See documentation and above for
	information.  While this is an incompatible change, it is better
	than the alternative: adding yet another LDMPI class and method
	signature. 

	* Citizen
	Rename "shortCircuit" option to less deceptive name "alwaysSerialize".

1999-07-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropertyWriter
	Added facility for defining properties which take arguments,
	supplied by LDM plugin handlers.

1999-07-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* NewSchedule
	Add some mutators for schedules.  COF returns
	NewSchedule. ScheduleImpl implements full api.

1999-07-27  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PropertyWriter
	New facilities:  Generic Collection types, e.g. Collection<Role>
	now fully supported.  Slots may be left unspecified or the def may 
	specify a class to "new" for initial value. Add property controls
	to allow specification of getters/setters - eliminates need for
	some adapters. 

1999-07-26  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Roles
	Initial work on getting Collections of Roles into the Asset tree.
	OrganizationCapability and AssignedCapability gets a Collections
	of Roles instead of a CSV string.  Complete backward compatability
	maintained with an adapter class offering the old, now deprecated
	methods. 

1999-07-23  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Workflow.isPropagatingToSubtasks
	Replaces isPropagatingRescind.  Name changed to reflect two
	changes: (1) default value has changed to false, (2) that in
	addition to rescind, add is also propagated when set.

	* alp.cluster.ActiveSubscriptionObject
	implemented by various ldm object so that some
	subscription-related code can be executed at add/remove/change-
	time.  The methods can return false to veto the events.  This
	moves the object vs Subscription interaction code from LPs into
	the affected objects.  WorkflowImpl, PlanElementImpl and TaskImpl
	all implement ASO.
	
1999-07-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* mdla.cluster.LogPlan
	Cleaned up redundant events generated by logic providers.
	
1999-07-16  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Asset
	New method setProperty(Property) does The Right Thing with any
	valid propertyset object.  Uses introspection to figure out the
	setter to use, or uses addOtherProperty as fallback for "foreign"
	properties.  Support changes in all PropertyGroups via
	PropertyWriter. 
	
1999-07-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MB5.2
