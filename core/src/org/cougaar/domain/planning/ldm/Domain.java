 * Factory class, and a set of LogicProviders.
 *
 * Domain classes must also implement a static
 * create() method so that they can be constructed
 * by the infrastructure.
 *
 * Domains may optionally implement <pre>Collection<String> getAliases()</pre>
 * to present alias names to the domain manager.  This feature is likely
 * to be removed in short order, as it is only to allow backward-compatability
 * when domain names change.  Use of domain aliases may result in warnings.
