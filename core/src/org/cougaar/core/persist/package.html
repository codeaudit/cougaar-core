This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
persistence and rehydration support.
<p>
The primary client is the {@link 
org.cougaar.core.blackboard.StandardBlackboard}, which uses
persistence to periodically capture the agent's blackboard state,
and rehydrate that state when the agent is restarted (either
from a crash or mobility).
<p>
A modified {@link java.io.ObjectOutputStream} and {@link
java.io.ObjectInputStream} is used to support persistence deltas,
where references to unchanged objects are serialized instead of
the full objects.  This requires Cougaar to override these
JVM classes on the Java command line, by using:<pre>
 -Xbootclasspath/p:$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/    .... something ...
</pre>
<p>
Additional {@link org.cougaar.core.persist.PersistenceService}
clients include the agent's component model manager, which saves
the agent's list of components in the persistence snapshot.
<p>
