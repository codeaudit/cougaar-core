/**
 * This persistence plugin saves and restores plan objects in
 * files. There is one optional parameter naming the persistence
 * root directory. If the parameter is omitted, the persistence root
 * is specified by system properties.
 * @property org.cougaar.install.path Used by FilePersistence as the
 * parent directory for persistence snapshots when there is no
 * directory specified in configuration parameters and
 * org.cougaar.core.persistence.path is a relative pathname. This
 * property is not used if the plugin is configured with a specific
 * parameter specifying the location of the persistence root.
 * @property org.cougaar.core.persistence.path Specifies the directory
 * in which persistence snapshots should be saved. If this is a
 * relative path, it the base will be the value or
 * org.cougaar.install.path. This property is not used if the plugin
 * is configured with a specific parameter specifying the location of
 * the persistence root.
