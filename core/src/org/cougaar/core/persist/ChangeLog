        * BasePersistence.java:
        * PersistenceOutputStream.java:
        Bug #2436 -- Replaced ByteArrayOutputStream with linked-list 
        buffers.  Also fixed the initial mobility state-capture buffer 
        size.

	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	* FilePersistenceBase.java:
	* DummyPersistence.java:
	* PersistencePlugin.java:
	Bug #2139 --  New 9.4.1.3 persistence problems with Robustness
	Change plugin API to avoid useless stream and reduce the
	likelihood of malformed object streams.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #2137 -- Need to catch security and IO exceptions from DataProtectionService
	Change e.printStackTrace into logger.error("msg", e);
	Bug #2139 -- New 9.4.1.3 persistence problems with Robustness
	Avoid NPE by checking for null uidServerState.
	Remove useless layer of stream wrapping to avoid malformed object
	streams when using data protection.
	Bug #2135 -- Persistence is calling DataProtectionService though
	it is not enabled in CSMART
	When using dummy persistence, never open any output streams, never
	use dataprotectionservice and don't even bother serializing the
	state unless the bytes are to be returned for mobility. Always
	update the identity table.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1864 -- NPE on Blackboard Subscriber closing transaction
	If a broken Composition/MPTask/Aggregation structure is persisted,
	it comes back with nulls in the composition list. Find and remove
	such nulls to prevent a subsequent NPE.

2002-07-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Various Persistence bugs.
	Squelch the info message about failing to find saved subscriber
	state for subscribers that do not expect to have saved state.

2002-07-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Change System.exit() to a warning and fixup.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java: 
	* PersistenceInputStream.java:
	Bug # 1640 -- Exception when trying to rehydrate
	References to PlanElements that have not been (or are no longer)
	published should not be persisted. The code to do this erroneously
	accounted for the omitted objecs (by counting them as existing).
	However, omitting the object from the persistence snapshot will
	result in null references after rehydration. In the case of the
	tasks of workflows and the aggregations of compositions, these
	null will usually lead to NPE. The presence of such objects is
	indicates a problem at the application level so the debug message
	has been rephrased as an ERROR message.

2002-07-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Fix bad ContextTable change in rehydrate().

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java: 
	* PersistenceInputStream.java: 
	Restore debug code that got lost during LoggingService conversion.

2002-07-09  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1616 --
	Change warning about missing security services to INFO level.

2002-06-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BufferedFilePersistence.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Persistence plugin that soaks up persistence output into ram
	buffers and spools out the data to a (presumably slow) file
	system. This allows the writing of a persistence snapshot to
	complete more quickly and let the actual data writes proceed in
	the background.

	* BufferedFileSystem.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	New file provides support for BufferedFilePersistence plugin.
	Opens buffered file output streams using a separate thread to
	spool the data to the file long after the stream has been written
	and closed. Uses up to 10 MBytes of buffering. Provides hooks for
	synchronizing renames and reads with the buffered output.

	* FilePersistence.java:
	* FilePersistenceBase.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Factored out the code common to all file-based persistence plugins
	into FilePersistenceBase.java leaving just abstract method
	implementations in FilePersistence.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Use StringUtility.parseCSV() to parse plugin parameters. This
	allows for quoting the separator character which is necessary for
	specifying a drive letter in a directory name.

	* DataProtectionServiceStub.java: 
	* DataProtectionOutputStreamStub.java:

	* NonPersistable.java
	Bug #1551 -- NonPersistable not used
	Removed. Use NotPersistable
	
	* FilePersistence.java:
	Bug #1551 Directory creation race
	Unconditionally call mkdirs to create the path to the persistence
	root directory. Then verify that it exists and throw an exception
	if it does not. The cost of calling mkdirs when it's not needed is
	miniscule.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1536 -- NotPersistable object are persisted
	Revise copyAndRemoveNotPersistable to actually remove
	EnvelopeTuples for not persistable objects. Copies of Envelopes
	having such tuples are created without the not persistable
	objects. Use copyAndRemoveNotPersistable to filter not persistable
	objects out of pendingEnvelopes and transactionEnvelopes of
	PersistenceSubscriberState.
	
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1539 -- Publishable.isPersistable is ignored
	The isPersistable test now covers both NotPersistable objects and
	Publishable objects for which the isPersistable method return
	false.

	* NotPersistable.java:
	Bug #1537
	Fix javadoc to more accurately describe this marker interface.

2002-06-18  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1511
	Rehydration sets are reversed preferring oldest over newest.
	Reversed to the sign of the comparisons to fix.
	

2002-06-14  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistencePlugin.java:
	Add methods to support DataProtectionService.
	storeDataProtectionKey stores the encrypted key and
	retrieveDataProtectionKey retrieves it.

	* FilePersistence.java: 
	Implement additional methods to support DataProtectionService.
	The keys are stored in files named key_<delta number>.
	
	* DummyPersistence.java:
	Implement additional methods to support DataProtectionService.

	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	Define methods for using DataProtectionService, but implementation
	just throws an exception -- that is, DataProtectionService cannot
	presently be used with a Database persistence medium.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Add DataProtectionService. Implement DataProtectionServiceClient.
	Use DataProtection Service to wrap input and output streams.

2002-05-09  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Re-interpret "disabled persistence" as install only the dummy
	persistence plugin and run persistence at a minimal rate. This
	leaves the persistence mechanism available for getting agent state
	for agent mobility.

2002-05-07  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* FilePersistence.java:
	Default persistenct root directory to <org.cougaar.workspace>/P
	Default <org.cougaar.workspace> to <org.cougaar.install.path>/workspace

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Insure that the currentPersistPluginInfo is never null while
	persisting.

2002-04-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Move the "finally" clause from rehydrateFromStream to the caller
	(rehydrateOneDelta) where access to the correct persistence plugin
	is possible.

2002-04-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceControlPlugin.java:
	Plugin to control persistence. Interrogates the persistence
	service for all controls and creates OperatingModes for those
	controls. Then monitors the OperatingModes and adjusts the
	controls accordingly.

	* PersistencePluginAdapter.java:
	Adapter for PersistencePlugin implementations defining default
	implementations of several methods that seldom need to be tailored
	by the plugin. This methods include the new methods for specifying
	media-specific controls.

	* PersistencePlugin.java:
	Add methods for media-specific controls (OperatingModes)

	* FilePersistence.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	Used PersistencePluginAdapter for common functions.

	* FilePersistence.java:
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Obtain media-specific services using PersistencePlugin
	implementations instead of sub-classing BasePersistence. Basic
	operation has not changed only refactored.
	Convert to using LoggingService instead of writing history and
	other files.

2002-01-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	Fix bug 1014
	The query to update the status of incremental deltas in the
	database was being overwritten with the query to update the status
	of full deltas so incremental deltas remained active forever and
	were never scavenged. Also the argument specifying if a delta were
	full or not was misspelled and so no delta was ever marked as
	"full". Consequently, all deltas were incremental and never
	scavenged.
	There was no provision to scavenge full deltas when archiving is
	disabled. This now fixed so the persistence database can be kept
	as trim as possible.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Fix bug 1014
	Document clear property
	Add org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.archivingDisabled
	property to allow archiving to be disabled.
	Add org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.consolidationPeriod
	property to control how ofter full deltas are generated. Defaults
	to 10 which it is the prior hard-coded value

2001-11-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Persistence.java: 
	* FilePersistence.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java:
	Add getDatabaseConnection and releaseDatabaseConnection to
	Persistence interface for use by Delta. This avoids casting the
	Persistence interface into a DatabasePersistence in order to
	access these methods. The methods throw
	UnsupportedOperationException in the non-database implementations
	of this interface.

2001-09-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceException.java (Repository):
	Add a little javadoc.

2001-08-31  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Persistence.java: 
	* FilePersistence.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java: 
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Add suffix argument to disableWrite and readSequenceNumbers
	methods to allow arbitrary archive to be specified from the
	command line. In the case of DatabasePersistence, the suffix is
	parsed into its numeric value and used to query for the correct
	archive delta.

2001-08-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Persistence.java: 
	* FilePersistence.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java: 
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Change interface to permit full versus incremental persistence.
	Retain full persistence deltas for archiving. Also make an extra
	copy of the sequence file for each full delta. This facilitates
	returning to archived data.

2001-08-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Remove clusters List, it's not needed and it holds onto old
	clusters after they have been moved elsewhere.

2001-08-13  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* RehydrationResult.java:
	Used to pass back the MessageManager after rehydration in addition
	to the old return result. The MessageManager is not managed by the
	persistence module any more. See BasePersistence.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java:
	Add accessor to get the bytes of the output stream. Used to
	provide the object needed to implement getState().

	* PersistenceObject.java:
	A wrapper around a byte array of serialized persistence
	information. Used to implement the component getState methods.

	* PersistenceNotEnabledException.java:
	An exception to throw when an operation requires persistence to
	be enabled and it isn't.	

	* Persistence.java:
	Change interface to pass additional information in and out when
	performing persistence. See BasePersistence for details.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Move management of MessageManager out of this class. It is now
	only a special object needing persistence (if present at all). Add
	rehydration from a PersistenceObject object containing a byte
	array of serialized persistence info. Intended for use with
	dynamic agents to rehydrate an agent at a new location. Also, on
	the other side, return said PersistenceObject when creating a
	persistence delta, if requested.
