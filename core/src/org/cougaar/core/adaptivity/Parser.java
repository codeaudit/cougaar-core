/**
 * Parser for plays to be stored in a Playbook. The grammar is
 * straightforward with the exception of ranges and range lists.
 * <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
 * <p>Each play consists of an if clause (predicate) and one or more
 * constraint phrases. These are all separated by colons and
 * terminated with a semi-colon. For example:</p>
 * <pre>&lt;if clause&gt;:&lt;constraint&gt;:...&lt;constraint&gt;;</pre><p>
 * The &lt;if clause&gt; is an expression involving {@link Condition}s and
 * constants that must evaluate to true or false. A constraint
 * consists of an {@link OperatingMode} following by a
 * ConstraintOperator and a range list and signifies that the
 * OperatingMode will be constrained so as to satisfy the relation
 * specified by the operator to the range list. For example:</p>
 * <pre>
 * FooPlugin.MODE &lt; 5;
 * FooPlugin.MODE in {1 to 7};
 * FooPlugin.SPEED = "FAST";</pre><p>
 * Note that both relational and range operators (==, not it, etc.) as
 * well as assignment may be used. Assignment explicitly specifies the
 * allowed values. Relational and range operators implicitly specify
 * the allowed values by specifying the test that any such value must
 * satisfy. The operators =, ==, and in are all equivalent as are !=
 * and not in. The other relational operators are usually used with
 * single valued range lists (constants).
 * <h3>Comments</h3><p>
 * Comments are ignored by the parser. Both slash-slash and slash-star
 * comments are recognized. The former beging with two adjacent
 * slashes and terminate at the end of line. The latter terminate with
 * a star-slash sequence.</p>
 * <h3>Numeric Constants</h3><p>
 * Numeric constants are interpreted as floating point numbers
 * (doubles). When necessary, numbers will be automatically cast to integers or
 * longs. A consequence of this is that plays may not use the full
 * precision offered by longs (64 bits) and are restricted to the 56
 * bits of precision in a double.
 * <h3>Ranges</h3><p>
 * A range is written as two numbers separated by the keyword "to" or
 * "thru". The former excludes the end point and the latter includes
 * the end point. A point range (a range having exactly one value) may
 * be written as a single number; 7 is equivalent to 7 thru 7. 7 to 7,
 * on the other hand, is an empty range; it allows no values.
 * <h3>Range Lists</h3><p>
 * A range list is a sequence of ranges enclosed in braces. The
 * elements of a range list may be separated by commas, but they are
 * not required; white space is sufficient. A range
 * list consisting of exactly one range my omit the braces.
 * Consequently, a numeric constant is also a range list. Range lists
 * frequently have elements that are point ranges and express list of
 * descrete values rather than a continuum. Range lists
 * may appear only as the right-hand operand of relational operators
 * (see below). Numeric constants may appear in arithmetic expressions.
 * to the written value. In general the context makes it clear which
 * should be used, but for example:</p><pre>
 * Foo &lt; {11 to 20, 25 thru 30, 1 to 3};</pre><p>
 * is true if Foo is less than 1 (the minimum of the ranges). This
 * characteristic is an artifact of the parser and probably
 * insignificant to the playbook writer.</p><p>
 * As implied above, a range list consists of one or more ranges
 * enclosed in braces. The comma between the ranges is optional (white
 * space is sufficient). The braces are also optional if the list has
 * a single range. Each range consists of either one number or string
 * or two numbers or strings separated by either "to" or "thru". "To"
 * signifies a range that does not include the end point whereas
 * "thru" signifies a range that does include the end point. If the
 * number is floating point, only the exact value given by the end
 * point is excluded. The next smaller value that can be represented
 * is always included. This characteristic can be used to insure there
 * are no gaps in the coverage of a series of predicates. For
 * example:</p><pre>
 * x in {1 to 3, 5 to 10}:...;
 * x in {3 to 5}:...;
 * x &gt;= 10:...;</pre><p>insures that exactly one of the predicates
 * is true for any
 * value of x from 1 to infinity. There is no value of x that can fall
 * into a crack in the vicinity of 3 or 5 or 10 nor is there any value of x
 * in those same regions that can cause two predicates to
 * fire.</p><p>Numbers are parsed as doubles and coerced to other
 * numeric typs as needed. This means that long values cannot be
 * written with their entire range. (Doubles can exactly represent
 * only 56 bits of precision.)</p>
 * <h3>Strings</h3><p>Strings are used as constants (range limits),
 * Condition names and OperatingMode names. The interpretation depends
 * on context (see below). Strings do not need to be quoted unless
 * they contain characters (such as spaces) that have syntactic
 * meaning to the parser. In particular, strings need not be quoted
 * when they contain . (period) and [] (brackets). All other
 * punctuation and special characters should be quoted.</p><p>
 * String constants can be used in range lists and arithmetic
 * expressions using the + operator. Strings cannot be used in other
 * arithmetic expressions. String comparisons are usually
 * confined to equality and inequality tests, but the other operators
 * have a defined meaning (alphabetic comparison using the default
 * collation sequence). String ranges are rare, but if used, have a
 * slightly different meaning when "to" ranges are specified because
 * the highest value included in a "to" range would be infinitely
 * long. For example, the last string in the range "bar" to "foo"
 * would be "fon\uffff\uffff\uffff\uffff...". It is hard to conceive of
 * a use for a "to" range involving strings, so the infinite string is
 * truncated after the first "\uffff".</p>
 * Strings that name Conditions <em>can</em> be used in arithmetic
 * expressions if the named Condition has a numeric value. If the
 * named Condition has a String value, then only the + operator is
 * allowed.
 * <h3>If Clause Operators</h3>
 * <h4>Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /)</h4><p>
 * These have their standard meanings. The parser treats these with
 * standard precedence so parentheses are needed in the usual places.
 * When in doubt, parenthesize. There is no modulus operator (%).</p>
 * <h4>Relational Operators (&lt; &lt;= == != &gt;= &gt;)</h4><p>
 * Relational operators compare two quantities and yield a boolean
 * (true or false) result. Relational operators are <em>not</em>
 * commutative; the interpretation of the left hand operand is
 * different from the right hand operand. Strings in the left hand
 * operand always name Conditions in if clauses or OperatingModes in
 * constraints. Strings in the right hand operand are always values
 * (or range limits). So, for example, in the play:</p><pre>
 * FOO == HIGH: HIGH = FOO;</pre><p>The first FOO is the name of a
 * Condition, the second FOO is a value to be stored in the
 * OperatingMode named HIGH when the Condition named FOO has a value
 * equal to HIGH. For clarity, it is a good practice to quote strings
 * used as values and not quote strings that denote Conditions and
 * Operating Modes.
</p><p>Comparison of strings uses the default
 * collation sequence for characters.</p><h4>
 * Range Operators (in and not in)</h4><p>
 * Range operators test for inclusion in (or exclusion from) a range
 * list. The meaning is straightforward:</p><pre>
 * x in {1 thru 7, 10}</pre><p>is true iff
 * x has a value between 1 and 7 inclusive or has the value 10. A
 * range list is just a shorthand for a combination of less than and
 * greater than terms, but is easier to write and process.</p>
 * <h4>Boolean Constants</h4><p>The boolean constants true and false
 * may be used in an if clause. This is useful when developing a
 * playbook before the details are worked out or to deactivate certain
 * plays.</p>
 * <h3>Constraints</h3><p>
 * Constraints specify an allowed list of ranges to which an
 * <code>OperatingMode</code> can be set. The constraints from all the
 * plays (including those manufactured from policies) are combined
 * (intersected) to form the final constraint. Often this final
 * constraint is a single value, but when it has multiple values, the
 * minimum of the first range in the list is used. The constraint can
 * be viewed either as an expression that must be true or as an
 * assignment of a range list to the <code>OperatingMode</code>. For
 * example:</p><pre>
 * Opmode1 = 3
 * Opmode1 in {3 thru 3}
 * Opmode1 == 3</pre><p>
 * are all equivalent. The first assigns the single valued range {3
 * thru 3} to Opmode1. The second requires that Opmode1 have the value
 * 3 so that is in the range 3 thru 3. The third requires that Opmode1
 * be exactly equal to 3.</p><p>All forms of constraints are rewritten
 * as an assignment of a range list to the <code>OperatingMode</code>.
 * For example:</p><pre>
 * Opmode < 3</pre><p>
 * is rewritten as:</p><pre>
 * Opmode = {&lt;negative infinity&gt; to 3}</pre><p>
 * The process of intersecting the constraints from several plays may
 * not be clear. For example, if the if clauses of two places yielded
 * these two constraints:</p><pre>
 * opmode in {56, 128, 256, 1024}
 * opmode >= 128</pre><p>The combined constraint would be:</p><pre>
 * opmode in {128, 256, 1024}</pre><p>Another example:</p><pre>
 * opmode in 1 thru 10
 * opmode in 5 to 20</pre><p>The combined result would be:
 * opmode in 5 thru 10</pre><p>For a value to be included in the
 * combined range list, it must be included by the range lists of all
 * the selected plays. It is a playbook-writing error to allow plays
 * to be simultaneously active for which the combined range list is
 * empty. For example:</p><pre>
 * opmode in {56, 128, 256}
 * opmode < 56</pre><p>would be an error. Such errors are not detected
 * until they occur. When they do occur, they are logged and the later
 * constraint is ignored.</p><h3>OperatingModeConditions</h3><p>
 * OperatingModeConditions are intermediate variables the act as
 * OperatingModes in some plays and Conditions in later plays. This
 * allows certain plays such as those that result from policies
 * received from other agents to set the value of an agent-wide
 * OperatingMode that is then translated into component-specific
 * OperatingModes by using the agent-wide mode as a Condition in other
 * plays. For example, assume the following plays resulting from
 * inter-agent operating mode policies:</p><pre>
 * Threatcon > 3: DefensePosture = 2;
 * Threatcon <= 3: DefensePosture = 1;</pre><p>
 * and the following plays from the local playbook:</p><pre>
 * DefensePosture < 2: FooPlugin.keyLength = 56: AdaptivePlugin.fidelity = high;
 * DefensePosture >= 2: FooPlugin.keylength = 128: AdaptivePlugin.fidelity = medium;</pre><p>
 * The allows the outside agent to be unaware of the details of the
 * makeup of the agent by expressing its policy in terms of a
 * "DefensePosture" concept. However, the local playbook is developed with an
 * awareness of the agent makeup so it can contain plays to set the
 * operating modes of its plugins based on this
 * DefensePosture value.</p><h3>OperatingModePolicy</h3><p>
 * An OperatingModePolicy has the same syntax as a Play except that it
 * is prefixed with a name.</p>
