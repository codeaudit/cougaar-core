   * Rewrite the playbook so that all the plays conform to a new

   * OperatingModes of the policy. Then check if the conditions under
   * which the policy applies overlap with the conditions under which
   * the play applies. If there is overlap, rewrite the play as
   * follows: Change the if clause of the original play so it applies
   * only when the policy does not. Add a new play that applies when
   * both the original play would have applied and the policy applies.
   * The OperatingModes of the new play are those of the original play
   * but with the ranges of values reduced to those values that the
   * play and the policy have in common. If the set of allowed values
   * for any OperatingMode is empty, then no play is added. Finally,
   * the OperatingModePolicy itself is inserted as a Play to cover the
   * cases where the policy applies, but no play does. It is not
   * necessary to add any play predicates to this play, because by
   * construction all plays are compatible with the policy.
