<body>
This package contains the Cougaar adaptivity engine and client APIs.
Client plugins can register sensors ({@link Condition}s) and control
"knobs" ({@link OperatingMode}s) with the adaptivity engine.  The 
adaptivity engine plugin uses policy and a rule file
({@link Playbook}) to change the control settings, adapting the
configuration to match the sensor data.
