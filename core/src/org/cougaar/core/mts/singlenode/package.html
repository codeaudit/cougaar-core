This package contains a single-node MTS implementation, created for
performance characterization and MTS overhead computation.  It is a
very lightweight version of the MTS in which a single node is run
without the overhead of costly services (naming, wp, etc). It provides
the developer with an stripped test case for performance
characterization.
