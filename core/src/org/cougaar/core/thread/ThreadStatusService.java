/**
 * This service is designed to provide a low-fidelity snapshot of the

 * instances, one for each active or queued 'thread' (Schedulable).
 * The Record contains the name of the 'thread', the name of the
 * consumer for whom it was made, the name of the scheduler that made
 * it, the state (implicitly) and how long the schedulable has been in
 * that state, in ms).  These results are mostly useful as deugging
 * aids, for example in the Top servlet.
