  /**
   * Forward entries to all our peer servers.
   * <p>
   * The map keys are Strings and the values are Forward objects.
   * <p>
   * Like the ModifyService, the "forwardAnswer" can send back a
   * LeaseNotKnown response if the UID is not known (e.g. due to a
   * server restart), in which case the server should send the full
   * Record.  A LeaseDenied is never sent because this is typically
   * a race condition -- the remote server's "forward" is likely
   * on the wire and will correct the sender's tables.  Lastly, a
   * success Lease is not necessary since a lack of acknowledgement
   * is assumed to be an acceptance of the forwarded data.
   * <p>
   * Clients may see temporary inconsistencies due to propagation 
   * delays, but these should be minimal.  Races between clients
   * are resolved by deconflicting the entries based upon the
   * optional "version" entries in each record.
   * <p>
   * Larger inconsistencies may occur due to network partitions or
   * server crashes.  These conflicts are eventually remedied with
   * the server-side deconfliction code and periodic lease
   * renewals.  Additionally, as an optional optimization, a server
   * can detect another server's crash and forward a full copy of
   * its data to that server, by using the other "forward" method.
   * <p>
   * It's fine to submit a singleton map, but for efficiency a
   * client can use this API to batch requests.
