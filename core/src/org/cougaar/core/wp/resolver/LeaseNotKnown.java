/**
 * An "unknown lease uid" response from the {@link ClientTransport}'s
 * {@link ModifyService}, indicating to the {@link LeaseManager} that
 * an attempt to renew a lease failed because the server doesn't know
 * a lease with the specified UID.
 * <p>
 * If a client attempts to renew a Lease by passing the UID, and
 * the server doesn't know the UID, then this response is
 * returned to request the full Record of data.
 * <p>
 * This is used to cover two cases:<ol>
 *   <li>The server expired the lease due to lack of renewal
 *       (e.g. network partition) and the client must remind
 *       the server of the data</li>
 *   <li>The server has crashed and must be reconciled.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The Record should use the same UID as the Lease.  This will
 * ensure that duplicate or out-of-order messages will not
 * cause problems.
