   * For a "getAll" this is a Map of AddressEntry objects, and for
   * a "list" this is a Set of String names.  In case of failure
   * this may be an Exception (e.g. "access denied").
   * <p>
   * The client should send its latest view of its entries.
   * Rebound entries should show their latest value, unbound
   * entries should be excluded, and already-leased values should be
   * included.
   * <p>
   * The client should send a new Record with a new UID every time
   * it changes its local data.  Renewals and retries should send
   * the current UID.
   * <p>
   * <b>NOTE:</b>
   * This design currently doesn't support "bind" operations; it
   * upgrades all binds to rebinds.  This was done to expedite the
   * white pages implementation, but should be revisited in the near
   * future.  The problem with "bind" operations is that they are
   * difficult to replicate (is "already bound" tested at one server
   * or all servers?) and difficult to retry if a server is down
   * (what if one server says "ok" and the other says "already
   * bound?).
   * <p>
   * The proposed implementation is to tag entries with a
   * "bind-only" flag, then allow any server to reject these
   * specific entries.  If a server rejects any of the "bind-only"
   * entries, and the request contains rebind or unbind operations,
   * then the client must send a new Record modification (excluding
   * the "bind-only" operations) with a new UID.  This will
   * guarantee that duplicate or lost messages won't cause
   * confusion over bind-only operations.
   * <p>
   * The reason for throwing away the failed bind modification is
   * illustrated in this example: say the record proposed two
   * actions:<pre>
   *    <i>uid=u/1</i>
   *    bind   X=Y
   *    rebind P=Q
   * </pre>
   * The request is sent to server A, which attempts to send back
   * a partial-failure that accepts "P=Q" but rejects "X=Y" due
   * to a prior binding.  At this point the network goes down, so
   * the client retries at server B, which accepts both actions
   * and tells the client the new lease.  Server B crashes, server
   * A comes back up, and the client attempts to renew its
   * lease on uid <i>u/1</i> at server A.  Server A renews just
   * "P=Q", which is the wrong partial record instead of the full
   * record data.
