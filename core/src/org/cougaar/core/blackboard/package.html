This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
publish/subscribe {@link org.cougaar.core.service.BlackboardService}.
<p>
The standard agent contains a {@link
org.cougaar.core.blackboard.StandardBlackboard}
component that provides the {@link
org.cougaar.core.service.BlackboardService}, which is a wrapper
around the {@link org.cougaar.core.blackboard.Subscriber}
class.  The StandardBlackboard creates the {@link
org.cougaar.core.blackboard.Distributor}, which
manages the subscribers, and the special {@link
org.cougaar.core.blackboard.Blackboard} subscriber
to maintain a view of all blackboard objects and
invoke {@link org.cougaar.core.domain.Domain} {@link
org.cougaar.core.domain.LogicProvider}s.  Each subscriber has a set
of {@link org.cougaar.core.blackboard.Subscription}s that are known
only to that subscriber.  A subscriber registers with the distributor
to receive blackboard add/change/remove notification "tuples".
When a subscriber wishes to modify the blackboard contents,
it must start a distributor transaction, fill an envelope with
add/change/remove tuples, and finish the distributor transaction.
The distributor also coordinates periodic persistence and ensures
that blackboard updates are thread-safe.
