/**
 * A container for blackboard add/change/remove {@link
 * EnvelopeTuple}s of a single transaction.
 * <p>
 * An envelope is not synchronized; it is privately held by a
 * subscriber and passes through the distributor in a thread-safe
 * manner.
 * <p> 
 * Several types of transaction operations are supported:
 * <pre> 
 *   ADD        add an object to the set.
 *   REMOVE     remove an object from the set.
 *   CHANGE     mark the object as changed in the set.
 *   BULK       like ADD of a set of Objects, with the
 *                slightly different functional semantics.
 *                In particular, since these are only emitted
 *                Blackboard on initialization of subscriptions,
 *                and by PersistenceSubscribers on Blackboard
 *                rehydration, LogicProviders function differently
 *                on BULKs than ADDs, for instance, business rules
 *                which fire on new Blackboard elements and produce
 *                other Blackboard elements will not fire on BULKs
 *                because the BULK delta should already include
 *                *those* products.
