<h2>JVM stack dump support</h2>
<p>
This package includes:
<ol>

  <li><b>JniStackDump</b>:<br>
      The JNI implementation to signal a stack dump.
      <p>
      The library name is "jvmdump".  On Unix compiled file that
      must be in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or -Djava.library.path)
      is "libjvmdump.so".  On Windows the compiled file that
      must be in your %PATH% (or -Djava.library.path) is
      "jvmdump.dll".
      <p>
      If you're using the AppServer, and want to use the
      "-Djava.library.path=", your "server.props" should include
      a "java.java.library.path=" line.
      <p>
      This class is package private, but includes a "main(..)"
      method for testing.
      </li><p>

  <li><b>JvmStackDumpServiceComponent</b>:<br>
      A component which advertises the root-level
      "JvmStackDumpService" for use within the node.  This is a
      service-based wrapper for the above JNI code.
      </li><p>

  <li><b>JvmStackDumpServlet</b>:<br>
      An optional component which loads a "/jvmdump" servlet,
      which uses the JvmStackDumpService.
      </li><p>

</ol>
