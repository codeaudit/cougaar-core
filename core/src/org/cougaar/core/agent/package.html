This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
agent base class and bootstrapping components.
<p>
The top-level JVM {@link org.cougaar.core.node.Node} loads the
{@link org.cougaar.core.agent.AgentManager}, which will contain all
the agents on the JVM.  The AgentManager loads the configuration
service ({@link org.cougaar.core.node.ComponentInitializerService})
and the node agent {@link org.cougaar.core.agent.AgentImpl}, which is
an agent named after the "-Dorg.cougaar.node.name" system property.
Like all agents, the node agent's AgentImpl loads a single {@link
org.cougaar.core.agent.Bootstrap} component that specifies
the agent's initial component list.  The bootstrap loads the minimal
number of components necessary to read the XML configuration file
and/or persistence snapshot, which will fill in the full agent
configuration.  The node agent's {@link
org.cougaar.core.node.AgentLoader} then instructs the AgentManager
to load the other agents that should run on the node.
<p>
Many of the components in this package are not required by the
bootstrap but are used in the standard agent XML/XSL template
($CIP/configs/common/SimpleAgent.xsl) to load basic services.
For example, the {@link org.cougaar.core.agent.MessageSwitch}
component is used to provide a common message transport service
interface for components within the agent.
<p>
Also note that many of the components and services in this package
act as "glue" to coordinate agent bootstrapping and mobility.
For example, the {@link org.cougaar.core.agent.MessageSwitch}
component is loaded early to allow other agent components to register
{@link org.cougaar.core.agent.service.MessageSwitchService} handlers,
such as the blackboard's {@link org.cougaar.core.agent.QueueHandler}.
However, message delivery must wait until all components have
loaded and had a chance to register their handlers, otherwise these
early messages will be dropped.  The MessageSwitch advertises a
"glue" {@link org.cougaar.core.agent.MessageSwitchUnpendService}
with an "unpendMessages()" method that will release the queued
messages.  A trivial {@link
org.cougaar.core.agent.MessageSwitchUnpend} component is loaded
late in the agent, after all the other components have been loaded,
just to invoke the "unpendMessages()" method at the right time.
