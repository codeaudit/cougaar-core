This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
primary core service APIs.
<p>
The general rule is to place service APIs in
"org.cougaar.core.service" if they are used by many clients
(e.g. the {@link org.cougaar.core.service.BlackboardService})
or if the implementation is defined in an external module (e.g.
the {@link org.cougaar.core.service.MessageTransportService}).
<p>
However, for legacy reasons, there are several exceptions to this
rule that could be refactored, such as the commonly-used {@link
org.cougaar.core.node.NodeControlService} and restricted
{@link org.cougaar.core.service.DomainForBlackboardService}.
<p>
