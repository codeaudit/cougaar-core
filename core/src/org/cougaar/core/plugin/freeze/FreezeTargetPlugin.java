/**
 * This component implements the actual freezing of an agent. Freezing is
 * accomplished by preventing the ThreadService from running certain
 * classes of components. The relevant object is the so-called
 * "consumer" of the ThreadService. For plugins, this is the plugin
 * itself. For other uses of the ThreadService, the "consumer" may be
 * different.
 * <p>
 * Generally, all plugins except those involved in the freeze process
 * are prevented from running, but this can be modified by rules
 * specified as plugin parameters. The rules are applied in this
 * order:
 * <pre>
 * "allow " + FreezePlugin.class.getName()
 * first plugin parameter
 * second plugin parameter
 * etc.
 * "deny " + PluginBase.class.getName()
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The form of the rule is one of the words, "deny" or "allow",
 * followed by a space followed by the name of the class or interface
 * that should be affected by the rule. The rule matches if it is
 * legal to assign the consumer to a variable of the type named in the
 * rule. This includes the class of the consumer itself, all
 * interfaces implemented by the consumer or their superinterfaces,
 * all superclasses of the consumer, and all interfaces implemented by
 * any superclass or their superinterfaces.
 * <p>
 * The first rule is built-in and cannot be overridden. It allows all
 * the freeze plugins to run while frozen. This is obviously necessary
 * to handle thawing a frozen society. The last rule is always added
 * and prevents all plugins that extend PluginBase from running except
 * those allowed by preceding rules. While it is possible to write a
 * component that behaves as a plugin but does not extend PluginBase,
 * this does not happen in practice.
 * <p>
 * The effect of this final rule can be nullified by including rules
 * (as plugin parameters) that specifically allow individual plugins.
 * Indeed, the whole class of plugins extending PluginBase could be
 * allowed. It is possible to prevent anything from being frozen in an
 * agent by making the first plugin parameter be "allow
 * java.lang.Object". Since every class extends java.lang.Object, this
 * will allow every class to run.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This is part of the older mechanism for freezing the society.  The
 * current mechanism uses FreezeServlet located on every agent in the society,
 * and depends on some external process to tell all agents to freeze.  This older
 * mechanism has not been removed so that people can continue to use a single servlet
 * to freeze the entire society, but the FreezeServlet mechanism is preferred now.
