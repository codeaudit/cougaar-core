/**
 * This component gathers and integrates freeze information from agents
 * in a society to determine the "completion" of the freeze operation.
 * In most agents, it gathers the information and forwards the frozen
 * status of the agent to another agent. This process continues
 * through a hierarchy of such plugins until the plugin at the root of
 * the tree is reached. When the root determines that ice has been
 * acheived, that is reflected in the freeze control servlet
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This is part of the older mechanism for freezing the society.  The
 * current mechanism uses FreezeServlet located on every agent in the society,
 * and depends on some external process to tell all agents to freeze.  This older
 * mechanism has not been removed so that people can continue to use a single servlet
 * to freeze the entire society, but the FreezeServlet mechanism is preferred now.
