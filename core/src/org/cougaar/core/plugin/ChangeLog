	* util/PlugInAdapter.java:
	Modify suspend() and resume() for the SingleThread model to wait for the thread to actually respond to the suspend or resume request

	* util/PlugInHelper.java:
	Update allocation results only when the change reports include a
	PlanElementImpl.ReportedResultChangeReport instance. This should
	be the only case in which it is necessary to update the estimated
	result. A new method, checkChangeReports, checks a set of reports
	for an instance of a given class. Used by the above, but available
	for plugins to use, too.

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java: Reuse newResult list instead
	creating a new one for each change. This is a major memory hog and
	reduces performance considerably.

	* util/PlugInHelper.java:
	Applies Bug #196
	Use isEqual instead of == to compare allocation results. Reduces
	extraneous plugin activation.

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Applies Bug #196
	Fix reconcialition of task preferences with phased results. The
	preferences are not necessarily in the same order as the
	allocation results.

	* util/PlugInHelper.java:

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	New class supporting phased allocation results needed for the
	correct handling of multi-day projections.

	* PlugInAdapter
	Provide default implementation of
	SubscriptionClient.getSubscriptionClientName of the form:
	<classname>[<params>]. This simplifies adapting plugins to changes
	made for persistence.

	* EssentialPlugIn 
	Make various method protected and/or final.  Update subscription
