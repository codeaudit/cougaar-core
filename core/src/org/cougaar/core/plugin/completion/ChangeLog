	* CompletionTargetPlugin.java:
	Remove GLM-specific specialization (verbs to ignore) and provide
	interface whereby domain specializations can tailor the verbs to
	ignore.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
	Don't start waiting for completion until the relay targets have
	stabilized. This makes it easier for subclass CompletionActions to
	work reliably by not trying to invoke such actions until all
	agents and nodes are present and accounted for.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java:
	Remove GLM-specific specializations and provide CompletionAction
	interface for extensions to specialize behavior such as publishing
	the oplan or sending GLS.

	* TestPlugin.java:
	A test plugin for debugging the completion determination. Provides
	a daily set of supply tasks derived from projections to give
	agents something to do as time passes.

	* LaggardFilter.java:
	Determines if a putative Laggard value is worth sending. Retains
	the last Laggard that was judged worthy of sending and judges if a
	new one should be sent depending on whether or not the change is
	significant or if sufficient time has passed.

	* Laggard.java:
	A brief summary of the state of laggardliness of an agent
	containing the cpuConsumption and taskCompletion values plus a
	boolean indicating if the agent is really a laggard or not.

	* CompletionTargetPlugin.java:
	A plugin for sensing agent activity and sending the completion
	status of the agent as responses to CompletionRelays. Both the
	presence and status of activity are sensed. If any Task or
	PlanElement is added, removed, or changed, the cpuConsumption
	countdown is restarted. cpuConsumption decreases linearly in time
	from 1.0 to 0.0 over a ten minute span. taskCompletion is computed
	as the average of the confidence ratings of the estimated
	allocation result of all tasks excluding certain tasks for which
	plugins fail to provide reliable confidence ratings
	(DetermineRequirements, getLogSupport and MaintainInventory).
	Updated values are sent as responses as warranted. Care is taken
	to limit the frequency of interesting, but insignificant changes.
	In particular, it really only matters if the laggard thresholds
	are crossed. Otherwise, the changes are not significant so updates
	are scheduled over long intervals.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
	Base class for plugins that send relays (CompletionNodePlugin and
	CompletionSocietyPlugin). Ascertains the correct set of targets,
	fashions a CompletionRelay and sends it. Retrieves the relay
	responses and dispatches them to subclass methods for handling.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java:
	The root completion plugin. Gathers completion status from all
	nodes and decides when to advance execution time.

	* CompletionRelay.java:
	A Relay to request task completion and cpu activity status from
	nodes and agents.

	* CompletionPlugin.java:
	Base class provides some common services to subclasses

	* CompletionNodePlugin.java:
	A plugin for completion sensing in a NodeAgent. Identifies the
	Agents of the Node and sends them a CompletionRelay so they can
	report back the completion state. Subscribes to CompletionRelays
	from higher levels and reports a completion state based on those
	of the node's agents (least completed agent).
