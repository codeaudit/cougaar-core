This package contains the <a href="http://cougaar.org">Cougaar</a>
agent mobility support.
<p>
The mobility infrastructure is loaded into the node agent by the
{@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.service.RootMobilityPlugin}, which
requires the {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.ldm.MobilityDomain}'s
{@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.ldm.MobilityFactory}.  Agents
register with the {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.MobilityService}
as {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.MobilityClient}s
to be told when they are moved, which requires them to
suspend and capture their persistence state.  {@link
org.cougaar.core.mobility.service.RootMobilityPlugin}s
in the source and target nodes communicate through {@link
org.cougaar.core.relay.Relay}s to transmit the agent and make sure
it is started on the target node before being removed from the
source node.
<p>
Plugins request agent mobility by interact with the {@link
org.cougaar.core.mobility.service.RootMobilityPlugin} through
blackboard {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.ldm.AgentControl} objects
that specify the requested {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.Ticket}
command, such as a {@link org.cougaar.core.mobility.MoveTicket}
to move an agent.  Additional tickets exist for adding and removing
agents.
