<h2>Agent mobility support</h2>
<p>
Agent mobility is divided into two primary pieces:<ol>
<p>
<li>
The infrastructure's services and implementation.  This
includes the low-level "MobilityDispatchService" and 
"MobilityListenerService" APIs, and only allows a 
component within an agent to request <i>its own</i>
agent to move.
</li>
<p>
<li>
The simplified "MoveAgent" API for plugin use.  This
includes the "MoveAgent" data structure, the 
"mobility" domain and factory to create this data
structure, and the "MoveAgentPlugin" to process the
MoveAgent objects.  The MoveAgentPlugin uses the
low-level infrastructure services to perform the 
move.  A Relay is used to transfer the request to
the to-be-moved agent.
<p>
The MoveAgent API is analagous to a Task-based API,
where the move "Ticket" is transferred between the
agents.
</li>

</ol>
