/** a snapshot of collected cluster metrics.
 * Various metrics come from different sources and may have 
 * very different horizons of validity:
 *  Cluster MessageTransport (CMT) - only available if Metrics 
 *    activated at the cluster level at startup. If the service is
 *    not available, these values will be -1.
 *  Cluster LogPlan (CLP) - always available, but not transaction-controlled
 *    so that numbers may be out of sync with other CL-class entries.
 *  Cluster (C) - always available.  Interesting slowly-changing cluster-related
 *    information.
 *  VM - always available, but all clusters running in the same node will
 *    have the same values.
