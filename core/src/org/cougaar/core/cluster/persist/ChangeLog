	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/RehydrationResult.java:
	Used to pass back the MessageManager after rehydration in addition
	to the old return result. The MessageManager is not managed by the
	persistence module any more. See BasePersistence.

	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/PersistenceOutputStream.java:
	Add accessor to get the bytes of the output stream. Used to
	provide the object needed to implement getState().

	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/PersistenceObject.java:
	A wrapper around a byte array of serialized persistence
	information. Used to implement the component getState methods.

	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/PersistenceNotEnabledException.java:
	An exception to throw when an operation requires persistence to
	be enabled and it isn't.	

	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/Persistence.java:
	Change interface to pass additional information in and out when
	performing persistence. See BasePersistence for details.

	* org/cougaar/core/cluster/persist/BasePersistence.java:
	Move management of MessageManager out of this class. It is now
	only a special object needing persistence (if present at all). Add
	rehydration from a PersistenceObject object containing a byte
	array of serialized persistence info. Intended for use with
	dynamic agents to rehydrate an agent at a new location. Also, on
	the other side, return said PersistenceObject when creating a
	persistence delta, if requested.
