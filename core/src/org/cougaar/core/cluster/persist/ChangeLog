	* Persistence.java: 
	* FilePersistence.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java: 
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Change interface to permit full versus incremental persistence.
	Retain full persistence deltas for archiving. Also make an extra
	copy of the sequence file for each full delta. This facilitates
	returning to archived data.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Remove clusters List, it's not needed and it holds onto old
	clusters after they have been moved elsewhere.

	* RehydrationResult.java:
	Used to pass back the MessageManager after rehydration in addition
	to the old return result. The MessageManager is not managed by the
	persistence module any more. See BasePersistence.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java:
	Add accessor to get the bytes of the output stream. Used to
	provide the object needed to implement getState().

	* PersistenceObject.java:
	A wrapper around a byte array of serialized persistence
	information. Used to implement the component getState methods.

	* PersistenceNotEnabledException.java:
	An exception to throw when an operation requires persistence to
	be enabled and it isn't.	

	* Persistence.java:
	Change interface to pass additional information in and out when
	performing persistence. See BasePersistence for details.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Move management of MessageManager out of this class. It is now
	only a special object needing persistence (if present at all). Add
	rehydration from a PersistenceObject object containing a byte
	array of serialized persistence info. Intended for use with
	dynamic agents to rehydrate an agent at a new location. Also, on
	the other side, return said PersistenceObject when creating a
	persistence delta, if requested.

	* ChangeLog -- created

	* Persistence.java Persistence interface.

	* FilePersistence.java Implementation of Persistence using files.

	* IdentityTable.java Augmented Hashtable to maintain
	correspondence between persisted objects and indentifying
	integers.

	* NonPersistable.java Marker interface for objects that should not
	be persisted.

	* NotPersistableException.java Exception thrown by attempts to
	persist objects that can't be persisted.

	* PersistenceAssociation.java Associates a reference int and a
	persistable object.

	* PersistenceInputStream.java ObjectInputStream subclass to
	implement persistence.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java ObjectOutputStream subclass to
	implement persistence.
	
	* PersistenceReference.java Replacement for previously persisted
	objects.

	* PersistenceSubscriberState.java Named container for the inbox	of
	a Subscriber.
