	* Added changes to support persistence:
	* Subscriber
	  Does not push outbox envelopes to Distributor.
	  Saves inboxes of transactions.
	* Distributor
	  Pulls envelopes from Subscriber along with inboxes
	  of uncompleted transactions.
	  Envelopes are always distributed by the Distributor; no
	  exceptions.
	* SubscriptionClient
	  Added getSubscriptionClientName so persisted inboxes can be
	  matched up with the proper subscriptions.
	* Envelope
	  Make Serializable so they can be persisted.
	  Remove originator. It's not needed and is hard to recreate
	  during rehydration.

  * Subscriber add in execution monitoring - commitment date checks to
  publishAdd and publishChange.

1999-02-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* SubscriptionClient remove now unused wake() method from
	interface. 

	* Distributor, DistributorTest Move Distributor point test
	code into its own file.

	* LogPlan, *LP, LogicProvider, etal. Unify the LogicProviders so
	that "message" flavors of LPs are executed by the LogPlan rather 
	than in the thread of the Cluster.  This simplifies the logic and
	makes the LP code slightly faster.

	* Subscriber, et.al. Subscribers now only wake up on subscription
	activity or on explicit wake requests.

1999-02-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Subscriber Split wakeSubscriptionWatchers functionality into
	three methods: 
	  signalExternalActivity(); // distributer passed new info
	  signalInternalActivity(); // plugin made changes to collections
	  signalClientActivity();   // plugin asked to be (re)awakened
	All callers updated to use the correct ones.

	* RescindLP
	Remove rescinded Allocation and AssetTransfer PlanElements
	from the respective Asset's RoleSchedule.
  
	* AssetTransferLp
	Minor cleanup
  
	* ReceiveAssetLP
	Move to using RoleSchedule object for available schedule setting.

1999-02-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* Persistence*
	New Subscriber, Envelope to support Persistence plugins.
	Persistence rehydrations are quiet - that is, they do not modify
	delta lists.

	* Subscriber
	Use Claimable interface (see org.cougaar.core.clusterobject.Claimable) to
	"claim" objects by the PlugIn which enters them into the logplan.

	Lazy outbox creation.

	Plugin-defined Envelope (outbox) class.

	* RemoteClusterAllocationLP
	Rewrite to correctly re-send messages from persisted PlanElements.

	* ReceiveTaskLP
	Stable behavior when receiving multiple copies of the same task.

	* Various
	use internal method to set the destination cluster of sent
	messages to prevent complaints from new code to prevent
	mis-directed messages.

	Better toString()

	* IncrementalSubscription
	Reduce consing for users of deltas lists.  Only cons new lists
	when the old lists were non-empty.

	* EnvelopeParseLP
	add isBulkEnvelopeTuple(Object)

	* DummyCCAdapter
	Proper transaction handling until the class is removed.

1999-01-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* org.cougaar.core.cluster.*
	Merge Subscription with ContainerWrapper with the intent of making
	Subscription the primary class. ContainerWrapper and subclasses
	have been made into deprecated interfaces implemented by the new
	classes.  The deprecated interfaces will be deleted early 1999.

	subscribe() returns Subscription rather than Collection.

	rename Subscription.getRealContainer() to be
	Subscription.getContainer(), deprecating old name.

	Revamp subscribe so that a Subscription may be passed as an
	argument.  See Subscriber.Subscribe(Subscription) documentation
	for details. This, in theory, allows plugins to write their own,
	though it is a dangerous proposition right now... perhaps careful
	finals would help.

* Added accessors to get, set, and advance ALP scenario time
