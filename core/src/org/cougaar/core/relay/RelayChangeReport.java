/**
 * A ChangeReport to be used when publishing changes to the target set
 * of a Relay. Failure to do so will cause dangling relay targets in
 * agents that are no longer in the target set.
 *
 * Usage is:<pre>
 *   Collection changes = Collections.singleton(new RelayChangeReport(relay));
 *   relay.setTargets(newTargets);
 *   blackboard.publishChange(relay, changes);
 * <pre>
 * The details of how you change the targets of your relay
 * implementation are, of course, your responsibility, but whatever
 * method you use, it is critical that the RelayChangeReport be
 * created before you change the targets since the change report
 * carries a copy of the old set to the RelayLP which uses it to
 * insure that the old targets are correctly reconciled with the new
 * targets.
