	* java/io/ObjectOutputStream.java:
	Copy of standard version with additional try-catch around the body
	of writeObject that prints the class and value of of the object
	being serialized whenever a NotSerializable exception occurs. This
	has the effect of printing the class and value of every object in
	the serialization stack and facilitates the identification of the
	offending object.

	* java/io/ObjectInputStream
	Make allocateNewObject public so that the new introspection-based
	code can invoke the method.  As a side effect, javaiopatch no
	longer needs to be compiled in any particular order w/rt other ALP 
	modules.
